<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface">Preface</a></h2>


<p>This message from my pen is not a work on
criminology or penology. No gathering of statistics,
nor comparative study of the works or
theories of learned authorities on these subjects
will be found within its pages. It is just a plea
from the heart of one who knows them, for those
who cannot voice to the world their own thoughts
and feelings. We ask no sentimental sympathy
or pity, no patronage or charity, but only understanding,
justice, and fair play.</p>

<p>My point of view is that of the cell. All I
know of this great sad problem that casts its
shadow so much further than the high walls of
prison I have learned from those for whom I
work, and my great joy in every labor is the
knowledge that "the boys" are with me. In
speaking of them thus I do so in prison parlance;
for just as Masons on the floor call each other
"Brothers"; soldiers in camp "Comrades";
men in college "Fellows"; so we of the prison
use the term "The Boys," and leave unspoken
that hated word "Convict," which seems to
vibrate with the sound of clanging chains and
shuffling lock-step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>If I do not write of others, who, during the
past century, have worked in prison reform, it is
not that I have disregarded their efforts, but as
this is a record of what I have personally seen
and learned, space and time will not permit the
recording of experiences which can doubtless be
read elsewhere.</p>

<p>In sending forth these pages of personal experience
I pray that they may stir the hearts of
the free, the happy, and the fortunate throughout
our dear country, that they, in their turn, may
champion the cause of those who cannot fight
their own battle, giving to them the practical
help that they so sorely need.</p>

<h2><a name="I_GOLD_IN_THE_MINE" id="I_GOLD_IN_THE_MINE">I<br />

GOLD IN THE MINE</a></h2>


<p>Long before the discovery of gold in Australasia,
geologists had pronounced the strata auriferous.
They had propounded to the world their theories
and scientific conclusions on the subject. Those
who read undoubtedly gave respectful credence
to their interesting treatises because of the learning
of the writers, and then as quickly forgot the
facts that had not very strongly appealed to any
personal interest. No one thought it worth
while to sell out business, and leave home to risk
or venture anything on the theories advanced.
The gold lay there untouched until one day some
shepherds from the bush came into Melbourne
and displayed fragments of rock encrusted with
glittering yellow particles which were found to be
pure gold. After that people believed, for they
had seen and to almost all the world "seeing is
believing." The shepherds knew nothing of
geology. They could not speak of the strata,
but they had found and could show the gold, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
in their footsteps tens of thousands followed in
the great rush that opened up the mines and sent
forth to the world the vast wealth that had lain
hidden for ages.</p>

<p>Many who have faith in the hopefulness of all
human nature have believed and told the world
of their belief in the possible reformation of criminals.
They have argued that every soul is
precious in the eyes of the great Father in heaven,
and that beneath the stain and dross of crime and
sin must always be some grain of gold worth redeeming.
Their great difficulty is to convince
those who are hopeless as to human nature and
who, seeing very vividly the evil, have not the discernment
to see beneath it any possible good.</p>

<p>To the world at large a State Prison has been
looked upon as an abode of the utterly evil, depraved
and good-for-nothing. In the slums are
the unfortunate victims of drink, the helpless
poor and straying ones who can still be sought
and saved, but in the prisons are those whose
lives are spoiled and ruined beyond repair.
Many of course give the subject no thought and
their prejudices are the result of utter ignorance.
Others form their conceptions from the sensational
accounts of notorious criminals whose
deeds have been exploited in the press. Some,
perhaps, base their unfavorable judgment on the
theories advanced against the possibility of reforming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the criminal, and speak as if our prisons
were full of perverted degenerates, at the mention
of whom it is proper to shudder and about whom
one can speak as of some species of human animal
quite alien to the common thoughts, feelings,
instincts and possibilities which are possessed by
denizens of the outside world. How truly may
it be said that prejudice builds a higher, thicker
wall around our prisoners than those of brick and
stone within which the law has placed them.
Naturally in my extensive travels all over this
country and my personal contact with people of
every description, I have had ample opportunity
to gauge the thought and feeling of the world
towards those in whom I am so deeply interested,
and, though during the last few years I have seen
with joy a very marked change of feeling, there
is yet much gross miscomprehension of the whole
subject.</p>

<p>Those of us who have become familiar with
the question on the inside of the walls have found
a veritable gold mine of possibility. We realize
fully however that it is only when they see this
gold for themselves that the world will lay aside
its doubting for faith in the future of these men
and, casting to the wind prejudice, will stretch out
a friendly hand of good-will to those who come
forth from the testing furnace.</p>

<p>We realized in the early years of its history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
that such a work as the one of which I write
could only be seen and appreciated by the world
at large in the years of the future when our
"boys" had come back into liberty and had had
time to prove the genuineness of their purpose.
Already this day has dawned, and all over the
country the forerunners of the thousands still to
come are proving that the work is no experiment,
though naturally many have neither seen
them nor looked into the lives of those still in
prison. It is hard to make the wholly uninformed
concede that any good thing can come
from such a place. Many a time when talking
to friends after some drawing-room gathering, at
a dinner table or in the cars, they will say with a
look of almost compassion, "But are you not
afraid to talk with these men? Is it not very
dreadful to have to come into contact with
them?" I try to explain that they are my
friends, that the respect, courtesy and attention I
receive from them could not be excelled in any
circle of society; but the raised eyebrows and
incredulous looks tell plainly that I have not
answered the question, simply because to their
minds all criminals are of the same stamp as
Tracy, the James brothers and Czolgosz. They
cannot conceive of men of education, refinement
or gentlemanly instincts in prison.</p>

<p>Constantly I am asked, "But how can you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
talk to these men; what can you say; how do
you touch or appeal to such an audience?" I
answer, "Precisely as I should to any lecture
audience or from the pulpit of any fashionable
church." I am talking, not to the criminal with
the theft of a pocketbook or with manslaughter,
burglary or murder on his record but to the
man, to the soul, the heart. It is just here that a
grave error could be made. If we always associate
the prisoner with his crime, with the stripes,
the cell, the surroundings, we get wofully far
away from him and even find ourselves beyond
the point where we can reach him at all. The
crime was one incident of his life, his imprisonment
is but the fact of to-day. Before he was a
prisoner he was a man, and in the future world
he will be simply a man, so why not talk to him
and think of him as a man to-day. A lady was
recently being shown over a penal institution
(which will remain nameless save to say that it
was not a state prison), and the officer who was
explaining the system took her from room to
room that she might understand their régime.
He showed off company after company as a professor
might exhibit specimens in the different
classes of zoology, talking of them loudly in their
hearing. At last coming to one of the lower
grades he said, "You will note the inferior intelligence
of these men, their poorer development.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
These are much lower in mental and
moral capacity and there is very little hope for
them. They are many of them very degraded
and seem devoid of moral instinct." Certain
malformed heads and many poorly nourished
bodies were pointed out and all this while these
classified animals stood listening. How should
we like such an experience? What thoughts
passed through those minds, what fierce hate,
what hopeless despair may not have swept over
them as they listened to the summing up of their
case?</p>

<p>Prison communities come from no uncivilized
island where they form a different species of the
human family nor are they drawn from one section
of the population confined to the slums.
They are from the great, wide world at large.
Some have had homes of ease and comfort and
have been educated in our finest colleges and
schools. Society gives its quota, so does the
great world of the common people, while yet
others come from homes of poverty and some
from no homes at all. There are the educated
and the ignorant, the rich and the poor, the industrious
and the idle, the brilliant and the poorly
endowed. In fact our audiences in Prison are
much like the audiences that we meet in the free
world, save that their hearts are sore and sensitive
and that that great shadow of suffering, the awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
loss of liberty, has brought anguish, despair and
shame to quicken every feeling. Nowhere have
I found audiences more attentive, earnest and intelligent
than in prison and I find all who have
had any experience will compare them most
favorably with those of the outside. One thing
is very evident&mdash;superficiality, seeming and artificiality
have been swept away by the close and
bitter contact with life, hence the real man is
easier to recognize and reach. They in their
turn are quick to read and judge the speaker
behind the subject, the faith behind the doctrine.</p>

<p>Another gross misconception is the belief that
all men in prison are dishonest. People forget
how many and devious are the causes for which
men can be imprisoned. Sometimes when I
have asked a business man to employ one of our
"boys" the answer has been, "I am in sympathy
with your work and pity these poor fellows, but
in my business I dare not do it as there would
be opportunities to steal and it would not be
right to those whose interests I must protect."
This has shown me how constantly the thought
of theft and robbery is associated with all who
come from prison. There are many within the
walls who have never misappropriated a cent.
This does not mean they are guiltless, for their
crime may have very justly brought them to conviction
but there is no reason to imagine that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
because of that punishment they must be ranked
as dishonest.</p>

<p>Then there are those within prison walls who,
though evil well nigh all their lives, claim our
sincerest pity. They may have done desperate
deeds, may perhaps be ranked as habitual criminals
and may represent to-day the most hardened
and determined offenders and yet in strict justice
they should not be spoken of with harsh condemnation,
before the sad pages of their lives
have been read. The judge and jury take cognizance
only of the offense; the police and prison
record note the list of charges and the number
of returns to prison but those of us who seek to
know the man beneath the criminal have a right
to go back and ask ourselves, "What chance did
this man have to do right, to act and to be as
we are?" The answer sometimes is a pathetic
revelation of a loveless babyhood and childhood
where blows and curses took the place of kiss
and caress; a youth where revolt against society
in an embittered heart made it easy to develop
every evil tendency and to follow the lead of
those in the under-world who proved the only
possible friends and associates.</p>

<p>Many, many letters have I received from just
this class of prisoner. I remember especially
one that spoke of such a history. It was written
just after my first visit to Joliet State Prison and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
was in the natural unrestrained language of one
who had never learned the art of deftly turning
sentences. He began with an apology for bad
spelling and poor writing in which he explained
that it was the first letter he had attempted
to write in seven years, for he had no one in the
world who cared whether he lived or died. Then
he thanked me for what I had said to them Sunday,
adding, "You said you loved us. Nobody
ever said that to me before in my whole life and
I hardly know what the word means. You
spoke of home. The nearest approach to it I
ever had was my time in the kitchen of one of
the state prisons where the officer was very kind
to me." Briefly this was his story. He was
born in a poorhouse in Ireland and never knew
father or mother and received in childhood no
touch of love or sympathy. When still very
young he was sent out to work and soon found
evil companionship and was led into trouble.
He came out to this country only to continue on
the same path which was in fact the only path
he had ever known. It naturally led him to
state prison and his whole life here has been
spent within the walls except for the few short
holidays in the slums between the day of his
discharge and the next arrest. All through the
letter I could see that he had never dreamed
there was another life for him. He confessed he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
had never tried to be good, had had no inducement
or chance to be so. Very pathetic to me
was the closing sentence in which he said, "Now
that I know somebody cares, I will try." Let
me diverge from my point enough to add that
he made a success of the effort and became an
earnest member of our League. On his discharge
from prison he had a happy experience
at our Home and from there launched out into a
new life. He soon proved himself a good workman
and in time became the possessor of a
happy little home of his own and has for several
years been a useful member of society.</p>

<p>I have mentioned but one but I could fill a
volume with such stories. I do not think that
the happy and fortunate in this life need look
upon it as foolish sentimentality to pity the prisoners.
Surely our pity is no more misspent upon
them than upon the heathen for they too have
never seen the light that they might follow it.</p>

<p>A young man came not long since to our
Home. He was a poorly developed, broken-spirited,
frightened looking boy. His parents
died when he and his brothers and sisters were
very young. He was brought up in a juvenile
asylum, bound out to people who were hard on
him, ran away and herded with criminals. He
never knew home, love, sympathy or friendship.
Our Home was the first true home he had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
known. It took weeks to work a change in the
physical, mental and moral attitude of the man
but when the change commenced it was wonderful
to notice how he developed. Naturally he
became devotedly attached to the one bright
happy spot in a very sad and gloomy life. When
we sent him out to his first position which was
some way from the Home, he broke down and
sobbed like a child whose vacation is over and he
was so utterly homesick that those who had
offered him employment had to return him to us
so that we could place him somewhere nearer the
Home, for, as they wrote, they feared that his
homesickness was incurable.</p>

<p>Again wholesale condemnation should be withheld
by the thought that there are some innocent
men within prison walls. It is natural that justice
should sometimes miscarry and yet alas, the
stigma and brand remain with the man even
after his innocence has been proved. A man was
sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and
served sixteen and a half years. Most of the evidence
had been purely circumstantial and he was
convicted mainly on the testimony of one witness.
He was only saved from the gallows by
the earnest efforts of those who had known of
his previous good character. Last winter the
woman who had borne witness against him came
to what she believed to be her deathbed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
sending for the priest she confessed that she had
committed perjury. The matter being brought
to the Governor, the man was at once liberated.
To the world into which he passed nervous, unmanned
and broken, he will always be an "ex-convict."</p>

<p>At the present time I know a man who has
served nine years and is still in prison where he
has been visited by the boy whom he was supposed
to have murdered. His "victim," a mere
child, disappeared and this man, a tramp who was
overtaken in the forest by a search party was
held responsible. Some years after his conviction
to state prison, the boy returned from what
proved to have been a runaway adventure, alive
and well. It is sometimes very hard work to
make the wheels of justice turn backward for
those once confined within prison walls so the
man who was poor and friendless is in prison
still.</p>

<p>A young German who was a member of the
League told me one day his story, not with a
plea that I should help him for my "boys" know
that my mission is not to get them out of prison,
and I found he was serving an eight years' sentence
for an offense of which at the time of his
conviction he was utterly ignorant. When arrested
he could speak no English and understood
absolutely nothing of his trial. He had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
friends and could make no appeal and when he
found himself within the prison walls, he asked
to be enlightened as to what he was supposed to
have done. He was a very bright fellow, a
skilled workman and when he had mastered the
language, he very much impressed all who knew
him with his honest straightforwardness. I
brought the matter to the notice of the Governor
who on investigation was perfectly satisfied with
the truth of the story and sent the innocent man
home to me after he had served some six years
in prison. We found for him a good position
and he became a trusted and well-paid employee.
In the first years of his freedom he was able to
lay by money with which he later bought a farm.
He was married to an estimable young woman
and is now living a thoroughly honorable life.</p>

<p>These instances are cited, not with the idea of
proving that injustice has been done, but merely
to show that to look with horror and wholesale
condemnation at this great prison family is unfair
and that one may find much good metal
worthy of redemption, even from the standpoint
of those who despair of the man who has sinned
and fallen.</p>

<p>In contrast to some quoted comes the story
of a young man who was welcomed to the
same Home in Illinois after a term in Joliet. He
sat rather silent at the dinner table where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
newcomers had gathered around the white cloth
covered with its pretty table ware and substantial
fare. His companions thought he was dispirited
and afterwards finding him alone in a corner of
one of the parlors, one of the older inmates of
the Home asked him what was the matter. "Had
he had bad news?" "Oh no," he answered, "it
is not that. It is this Home. Just think of the
contrast! When I fell and was sent to prison I
thought I had forever made myself an outcast.
For years I have sat in a cell, dressed in the
stripes; I have drunk my coffee and water from
a tin cup and eaten my food from a tin plate.
When I sat down at that table to-night, I was reminded
of home and of the past and I seemed to
see the possibility of some day regaining what I
had lost." He was not a poor stray of the city
streets but the son of a Christian home. His
father was an Episcopal clergyman and his environment
had been one of comfort and refinement
until he had yielded to evil and started on
a downward course.</p>

<p>One of those whose return to rectitude I
watched with deep interest had been a professor
of mathematics. Another came from a family
with whom I came in touch through correspondence,
and found them honorable members
of one of the courts of Europe, and many
represent homes in this country very far removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
from the ignorance and neglect of the
slums.</p>

<p>It should also be remembered that there is in
many of our prisons a large foreign element of
the illiterate, ignorant and helpless who have
drifted to our country and easily joined the ranks
of the lawless if indeed they have not belonged
to them in their own native land. Some of these
however are in prison more through ignorance
than criminal intent.</p>

<p>When we come to inquire into the cause of
imprisonment, we are constantly impressed with
one fact, which cannot be denied, that the curse
of drunkenness has proved directly or indirectly
the ruin of between eighty and ninety per cent.
of all those in prison. Many a blow has been
struck, many a deed committed, many a robbery
perpetrated by those so under the influence of
this evil spirit that when they have come to their
senses in the prison cell they have asked, "Where
am I, what have I done?" and have literally had
no memory of the deed that brought them there.
It would not of course be in accordance with
common sense or justice to say that they were
therefore not guilty. They are guilty; they do
deserve punishment but have we not the right to
believe that, if delivered from this evil habit, they
might be found to be trustworthy and true-hearted
men?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>My experience gained by close contact with the
men in our prisons during the last seven years
has convinced me that but a small percentage of
the eighty-four thousand now within the walls
should be called criminals at heart. In this statement
I have been endorsed by wardens who have
had a far longer and more intimate experience
and who can speak from the standpoint of those
whose duty it is to watch very closely the actions,
character and tendencies of the men under their
charge. This has to do with the manner of men
in prison, the birth, position, etc., of those who
form the prison population, but what of the hearts
beneath the surface? No one could go into
prison with hope of success who did not possess
faith in the redemptibility of every soul, however
far from the light it may have wandered. There
is naturally, much to discourage. Many of the
men are utterly hopeless about themselves; some
are hard and bitter; others skeptical, liking to
boast, as do crowds on the outside, of their indifference
and carelessness. Yet for those who will
be patient; who will look deeper, there are pearls
beneath the turbulent waters; gold in the darkest
corners of the mine and diamonds glittering amid
the clay.</p>

<p>I believe that in every human heart however
hardened or hopeless the exterior, there is some
tender spot if one know rightly how to touch it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
some chord of sweetness that can be made to
vibrate to the very harmony of heaven amid all
the jangling discords of life; some little spark
that by the breath of inspiration may be fanned
into a flame and kindle the purifying fire. Amid
these whom many would give up as beyond reach
and unworthy of effort, I have found generosity,
unselfishness, sympathy, patience and cheerfulness
that would often teach people in happier
circumstances a striking lesson. How greatly
this adds to the hopefulness and courage of those
who have gone forth into this field can readily be
conceived. Many, many instances could I cite
but I will quote one case of kindness which came
under my personal observation. A young man
was serving a twenty years' term in Sing Sing.
The long sentence was nearing its close. Only a
year more stood between him and liberty. The
old mother over seventy years of age, who had
stood by her boy all through these dreary years
was very sick and reduced to direst poverty. Her
husband had died and after years of hard toil she
had reached the point where sickness and weakness
made money earning impossible, and eviction
was imminent. In this hour of distress she
appealed to her boy for help. He was able to
make a little money by over-time work. It was
very little, only a cent and a half a day or five
dollars in a whole year. He found on referring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to the Warden that he had already sent all that he
possessed to his mother. The thought of her
need and possible death from want drove him
nearly to distraction and yet he felt himself utterly
powerless to help her. In the same prison
was another man also serving twenty years. He
was an old timer, had served several terms before
and this one was a sentence he would probably
never have received had it not been for his past
record. When he learned of his fellow-prisoner's
anxiety, he took all his own earnings, twenty dollars
which represented the hard toil of four years
and sent them gladly to the old mother though it
meant depriving himself of all the extra little
comforts he might have purchased. Though for
later chapters I reserve the after lives of my
"boys" I must give the sequel of this story.
Both men came home to us. They became
earnest Christians and have good positions to-day
where they have proved themselves absolutely
worthy of our confidence. They are earning
good wages, have won the confidence of their
employers and the old mother has been well provided
for.</p>

"REMEMBER ME"</a></h2>


<p>As a little child I spent many a happy season
in the home of my dear aunt Miss Charlesworth,
the authoress of "Ministering Children." The
pretty tree-shaded garden of Nutfield Cottage was
bordered on one side by the quiet village churchyard
and a little private gate opened on the path
that led through it to the garden of Nutfield
Court, where our special playmates lived. By
daylight one could run blithely enough between
the old quaint head-stones, many of them moss-covered,
while other mounds were bright with
masses of blossom, when the breeze was playing
in the trees, the lark was sending forth its carol of
praise from the blue sky above or the quaint old
ivy-covered tower of the church might send forth
its glad peal of chimes. There was so much of
life and beauty that children could run back and
forth over the grassy path with no thought of the
death that lay still and solemn beneath the smiling
flowers and whispering grasses. But it was
a different thing entirely, if one walked back after
nightfall, with senses alert for every sound and
heart beating fast with unknown terrors. The
rustle of a bird in the ivy; the creaking of a dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
branch; the flitting of a bat's dark wing or the
play of moonbeam and shadow were things that
made the churchyard a place to be avoided for
now the memory was vivid that this was the village
of the dead. In those childish days death
held for me a great horror. The thought connected
with it, that which made me feel most
desolate, was the fact that when one was dead,
laid away deep in the earth and left alone in some
dark place beneath the tree shadows; to be covered
in by the snow, or swept over by howling
winds or dismal rains, the world would still go on
the same as ever. For others, bright home
lights would gleam, laughter and fun, companionship
and love, life with all it means would still
exist, while the dead would lie forgotten and
alone.</p>

<p>I have thought of these things and seen once
more the vivid picture and felt the thrill of those
childish fears as I have entered into sympathy
with "the boys" in prison. Prison to many is a
living death. They feel that they have dropped
out of life. The rendering of the judge's sentence
was the "dust to dust" of their burial
service; the rhythm of the wheels that bore them
away to prison sang the requiem of their despair
and desolation, and when the heavy iron door
clanged to behind them, it was like the falling of
the sod upon their grave. Henceforth they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
not of the world. In it they were dead and forgotten
and this bitterness was harder to bear
when they remembered that outside amid the old
scenes, the busy, happy rush of life would go on
just as blithely despite their sorrow. For others
the home light still gleamed; the sunshine, the
joy, the love of life which was still dear to them
was continuing in all its fullness but beyond their
reach. Forgotten! There is more bitterness
and tragedy in that one word than volumes
could describe. It holds a record of broken
hearts and embittered souls that blots the star of
hope out of many a sky. "What a man sows he
must reap. They deserved it for they have
sinned, they have broken the law and it is only
maudlin sentiment to pity and sympathize with
them," is a sentiment I have often heard expressed.
From the purely worldly point of view
this may be so, among those who feel in no sense
their brother's keeper, and believe that the one
who has fallen has put himself forever without the
pale of human sympathy. The whole question
can be solved by merely quoting the old saying,
"They have made their own bed, they
must lie upon it." To Christians, however, this
is impossible. No, I will say more. To any who
have an interest in their fellow-men and a loyal
love for their country, the grave responsibility
towards this vast prison population must loom up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
as a potential fact. Yet it has been a very much
forgotten subject.</p>

<p>"Remember me!" From the long ago past
this cry rings out to-day. How vividly we can
call up the scene before us, when lips white and
parched with death and anguish first spoke them
in the labored breath that was hurrying a guilt-laden
soul into the dark unknown hereafter. We
hear also the answer spoken in like mortal agony
by the martyred One at his side. With what
light it must have come into his darkness as
peace in the storm and very life to that dying
one, "This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise."
The Christ was perfectly aware of the
past. There is no intimation in the story that
the man was suffering wrongfully but the answer
was not, "You've no one to blame but yourself;"
"once a thief always a thief." The deed that had
brought him to death, the sin that had ruined his
life was forgiven, the soul that cried for help, that
believed in the power of the dying Christ beside
him was recognized by the world's Saviour. He
was called and welcomed to go into the mystery
of eternal life side by side with his Lord. That
same cry goes up to-day from every cell in our
dear Christian land, from those who represent to-day
that outcast of Calvary, "Remember me!"
To whom should it appeal more strongly than to
the followers and representatives of that same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Christ, who would have His glad message of hope
sent clearly and convincingly, echoing and re-echoing
into every dark and lonely cell where it
is so sorely needed. Has this been done? Do
the Christian people and philanthropists of our
land feel their responsibility to these men? Compare
this corner of God's vineyard with many
others and let us ask ourselves whether it has
had its share of prominence in pulpit and press
as a plea to efforts of Christian charity. I fear
not, and yet in the scene of the last judgment as
well as the one already quoted, we are reminded
that this is one of the Christ's requirements of
those, who would follow in His footsteps.</p>

<p>In response to those words, "Go ye into all
the world," this country has spent its millions on
foreign missions and sent forth thousands of consecrated
men and women in willing exile. The
Christ gathered little children into His arms and
blessed them, and the Church following the divine
example can show to-day its splendid Sunday-school
work, children's hospitals, orphanages,
nurseries, kindergartens and many other loving,
saving missions to the little ones. He healed the
sick, and His followers have poured out their
wealth in these days to give hospitals to the poor,
but He is also "in prison" and have we in like
manner visited Him there? I write thus and I
ask these questions because I have seen the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
need so vividly that I have been impelled to come
back from the prison world to testify that the
criminal problem is what it is to-day because it
has been neglected. If the responsibility for
those in prison was realized by the Christian
world as clearly as it has realized the need of the
heathen, the whole situation would in ten or
twenty years be revolutionized. It has been an
overlooked and in a great measure an untilled
field. Repeatedly was I told when I contemplated
making it my life mission, that my efforts
would be useless, nothing lasting could be accomplished,
and that these men were beyond hope,
but it has always seemed to me that such an argument
merely furnished a greater reason for determined
effort. I would not have any misconstrue
my statement and report me as saying that
this work was wholly neglected until our work
began. I speak in the wide sense and am comparing
this field with other fields of Christian activity
and in what I say, I believe all who have
worked in prisons will agree with me. There
have been of course some workers, loving, loyal
souls who have toiled away unknown and unrecognized
so far as the world is concerned, but
they are the few whose devotion only emphasizes
the fact that this field has been abandoned by the
forces that should long since have conquered it.
England in years gone by had her Elizabeth Fry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and John Howard. They did a lasting work, but
should not their example have been followed by
tens of thousands in that land? Her jails are
still full of prisoners and one of her oldest wardens
has declared with emphasis, after an experience
of thirty-five years, that he has known only
two cases of reformation in all that period. In
this country I could name other devoted workers.
I would not slight the consecrated toil of Chaplain
Barnes who for twenty-eight years has striven
with the devotion of a saint for the welfare of
"the boys" in Massachusetts, or of Mrs. Courtland
De Peyster Field who has for twenty years
led a Bible class in Sing Sing. There have been
earnest workers of the Society of Friends who
have done valuable service in Pennsylvania, and
in Iowa there are Sunday-school teachers who
have had a record of over twenty years of teaching
in the prison. But the call has been unheeded
by the many who are equally responsible
with the few who have heard and responded.
From every pulpit, in every Sunday-school,
through the pages of the religious press, the need
of the heathen is constantly kept before the people
and so impressed that the youngest child
knows all about it. What do the children in our
Sunday-schools or the congregations gathered in
our churches know of the need behind prison
walls? Where has any large offering ever been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
taken for this cause? Who has ever thought of
leaving a generous legacy for the redemption of
these men? I do not for a moment grudge what
has been given to missions. I merely want to
bring to remembrance these others who have
been overlooked, this occasion for help at our
very door, a need which may be unlovely and
have nothing about it of the glamour of romance
which distance lends to a cause, but which all the
same concerns human souls divinely loved and
groping in great darkness.</p>

<p>Those who have entered it can report that
here is a glorious opportunity. This field is indeed
white to the harvest and there is no reason
why mighty results should not be gathered where
people have been inclined to look only for disappointment
and failure.</p>

<p>In seeking for the cause of all this general indifference,
I can only conclude that the fact that
these men have been wrong-doers and are suffering
in consequence, has robbed them of sympathy.
If I were pleading for the abolition of
prisons, the lightening of punishment or were
making sentimental excuses for transgressors, I
could understand that the appeal might awaken
no interest, for it would appear to be a contradiction
to justice. What we do advocate is the
saving of these derelicts, that while in prison
and on their discharge, help be given them in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
practical way so as to prevent their relapse into
crime. From the purely worldly standpoint he
who has sinned is unworthy of help and therefore
is not an object of pity or sympathy. From
the Christian side of the question he is more to
be pitied and the more earnestly to be sought
after. Did not the Good Shepherd say He would
leave the ninety and nine to seek for the one
straying sheep? Surely his need of mercy is far
greater with the guilt of sin on his conscience,
its haunting memory robbing him of confidence
in himself or faith in efforts at reformation.</p>

<p>How much the attitude of the world towards
the prisoner and its prevalent opinion have
effected the men can hardly be imagined by an
outsider. Hope, encouragement and confidence
mean everything to any man in life's struggle.
Take only as an illustration, the attitude of the
doctor at the sick bed. He knows that his
cheering words to the patient mean almost as
much as his remedies, and were he to be forever
reminding the sufferer of each unfavorable symptom
and shaking his head disconsolately over
the prognosis with an admission that it was little
or no use to try and save him, the result would
be a depression on the part of the patient which
might even in many cases prove fatal. In just
this way have the morally weak and sick been
too often robbed of the hope and courage that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
might have meant ambition and effort in the
right and saving direction.</p>

<p>A learned writer some years since published
in one of our scientific papers a treatise concerning
criminals, in which he proved from his
own mental conclusions that they could not be
reformed. I did not read the paper but I saw it
mentioned in reviews and deplored the fact that
science should be prostituted to so demoralizing
a use. On the following Christmas day I planned
to spend my time visiting the cells in Sing Sing
and talking individually to as many of the men
as possible, for that is a day full of home memories
and the realization of loneliness is even
more keen and bitter than usual. To my surprise
I was met at cell after cell with the question,
"Have you read, Little Mother, what Professor
---- said about us?" and in some instances
by educated and skeptical men, it was
used as an argument against the duty of trying
to do better. If those who toll the bell of doom
for these poor souls in bondage, fully realized
how the damning tones echo and reecho in disheartening
vibration from prison to prison, from
cell to cell, they might understand that it is almost
criminal to break the bruised reed and
quench the smoking flax. What should we
think of the physician who should calmly and
cold-bloodedly put out the spark of life in a patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
where though his theories contradicted the
likelihood of recovery, some other doctor might
save life in the eleventh hour?</p>

<p>That there is a terrible influence in heredity,
no one can deny. The drunkard or impure
liver leaves the taint of evil appetite to be struggled
against by the children to whom he gave
life, but to use this as an argument against the
possibility of reforming certain men is a contradiction
of the teachings of Christ. His message
of hope is to every man; His offer of strength
and power to the most needy and unfortunate as
well as to those in whom one would naturally
look for godly aspirations. We have seen
enough in our work to understand that many of
those who have had the worst environment to
contend with, and have been handicapped by
miserable parentage have yet been able to accept
and respond to the highest teaching, and have
made a thorough success of earnest Christian
living. I was visiting Sing Sing on one occasion
when I had planned for a long list of interviews.
As was my custom I presented the list to the
Warden, who was deeply in sympathy with our
work, and we went over it together that he might
give me information that would prove useful in
meeting the wants of different men. Coming to
one name upon the list, he paused and asked me
if I knew the man. I told him that I knew him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
merely as one who had written me a few lines
requesting an interview. "Well," he said, "I
will tell you his reputation. We look upon him
as the worst and most treacherous man in this
prison. He is an habitual criminal, has probably
been a criminal all his life, has had several terms
in prison and has been constantly punished for
insubordination. Three times he has stabbed
officers and fellow-prisoners, he has been in plots
to escape and twice attempted to burn down the
prisons he was in. He has been a morphine or
opium fiend, and now he is being kept in 'solitary'
because he cannot be trusted with the
other men." I shall never forget my interview
with this man. It was towards evening of a
very busy day for I had between sixty and
seventy private interviews between the opening
and closing of the prison day. I was sitting in
the chapel close to one of the barred windows
that looked over the Hudson. The sun was setting
and the river gleamed like burnished gold
while great shafts of glory were flung upwards
from the hills tinting the clouds with crimson
and amber. Looking back from the brilliant
scene without I glanced down upon my papers
scattered upon the little table at which I was
seated. There I saw also the streaks of yellow
light but between each sunbeam lay the heavy
shadow of a bar. I sat there thinking how like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the lives of our "boys" was that contrast. In
every life there was that heavy shadow blotting,
discouraging, darkening the whole present and
future, and then turning from the sad side, I
thanked God that there was a sunlight that could
force its way even into the darkest gloom of
prison life, the sunshine of God's own love and
mercy, His pardon and His presence. I suppose
I had allowed myself to dream a little for I was
startled when I heard a shuffling footstep near
me. I had not noticed that the officer who
stood outside the door had ushered in my next
visitor. Looking up I saw a man who might
have been taken as a very type of the hopeless
habitual criminal. His walk, his attitude, the
furtive, distrustful look in his eyes, the nervous
twitching of hand and lip and muscles told of
one who had been hunted and caged. As he
stood there with his dark eyes fixed searchingly
on my face I saw how completely he had become
a nervous wreck and how he had lost his faith
not only in himself but in mankind. I rose to
say a few words of welcome, drew up his chair
near the table and yet he said never a word. I
noticed how the hand that he had laid on the
table to steady it shook and how the poor face
so white with prison pallor quivered with nervousness.
I told him again how glad I was to
see him and that he had done quite right in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
sending for me but it was not until some moments
later that he broke the silence and then
with the abrupt question, "Do you know who I
am?" I was going to give him his name as I
knew it, but before I could speak he leaned forward
and in the bitterest accents said, "I will
tell you. I am the worst and most treacherous
man in this prison." Then followed in short,
concise words, the story of the efforts to escape,
the insubordination, the attempts at incendiary
outrage. Pointing to the chains that hung upon
the pillar in the chapel, he said, "I have been
chained up there. I have been put in the dark
cells. I have been punished over and over again
but it has not any of it done me any good.
Would you like to know what the magistrate
who last sentenced me said about me? He said
after passing sentence, 'Take him away and lock
him up like a brute beast for that is all he is.'"
Then with indescribable pathos he turned and
said, "Do you think there is any hope for me?"
I was at once upon ground where I could speak
without hesitation, and I told him simply that if
he was through with an evil life, if he was tired of
wrong-doing and was thoroughly determined to
do right there was a love that could forgive him
and a power that could help and keep him in the
future. When at last we knelt together, there in
the glory of the setting sun, I prayed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
dear Lord, who could bring light into our darkness,
might dispel the thick clouds that had shut
in this soul from hope, and bring to him the
revelation that would change his life. There
were tears in the dark eyes as we parted, and
taking my hand in his he said, "I <i>will</i> try, Little
Mother." He did try, and more than that he
triumphed. At first it was a stern battle of an
awakened will and conscience fighting against
desperate odds. The feeling that a friend was
watching and waiting anxiously for good reports
proved undoubtedly an incentive. Just about this
time I was taken dangerously ill and had to go to
the hospital. The news was received with the
deepest concern within the prison walls and many
men who had never prayed in their lives were
found on their knees night after night asking
God to spare my life. A letter from this "boy"
reached my secretary in which he said, "I am
trying very hard to be good these days because
it says that the prayers of the righteous avail
much and I do want my prayers to help in making
the Little Mother well." It was not the
highest motive for being good but it was the best
that had thus far ever inspired this life and it
proved the stepping-stone to better things. It
was not long before he sought and found Christ
as his Saviour and became an earnest Christian.
When he left the prison I do not believe there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
was an officer who thought it would be possible
for him ever to make an honest living. That
was over five years ago. He is to-day a prosperous
and happy man. He has become by
hard work and faithfulness assistant-superintendent
in a large industry in which he is employed.
He has a comfortably furnished and happy home,
and is so changed in face and personal appearance
that I do not believe any of his old companions
could recognize him. Some three years
ago a detective, who had several times arrested
him, talked with him sometime without for a moment
suspecting it was the same man. So truly
when the heart is transformed do the face and
manner reflect the change. I quote from his
last letter to me written after our seventh anniversary
gathering:</p>

<p>"My dear Little Mother: I write to let you
know I enjoyed the seventh anniversary celebration
very much. How soon a man forgets the
years of misery in the days of happiness. My
wife was quite disappointed when I told her
of the mistake I had made in leaving her in New
York. How pleased she would have been to
have met you on such a great occasion. The
'boys' and their families all seemed so happy
and indeed it was a sight worth seeing. I have
a deep feeling in my heart for Hope Hall 'boys'
and have often taken one into my home for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
few days while he was out of work. Some day
I am going to own my own home and realize
what has been my day-dream. Do you remember
that it was your confidence in telling the
public that you would give them 'flesh and
blood facts' that made me resolve to be one of
the 'facts.' Well, I have fought the fight and I
have had a hard, even cruelly bitter struggle for
the first two years. How much sweeter is the
victory! I would not have it different. God
has been very good to us and we can see His
hand in the working of our prosperity. When I
think of those two years, the struggles and trials,
the hungry days and sleepless nights, it only
gives me and mine more zest in the enjoyment
of the God-given prosperity we have now. 'All
things work together for good.' You know I
had to learn a trade since I left prison and that
it was B&mdash;&mdash; G&mdash;&mdash; (one of our 'boys' who
had been a notorious burglar but has made a
success of an honest life) who taught me the
fundamental principles of this trade, at which I
am now earning a living that only good mechanics
can enjoy. Indeed no man can prosper
unless he hustles and pushes himself ahead, for
business people these days are carrying no dead
wood on their pay rolls. Thank you for the
very happy day, etc."</p>

<p>In this case there was certainly nothing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
past to bring in a hopeful aspect. His environment
had been of the worst, so had been his
parentage and rearing. From childhood his feet
had been trained to tread in the wrong path and,
as he once said to my dear co-worker, Mrs. E.
A. McAlpin, he did not believe in heaven or
hell, God or the devil.</p>

<p>Those who have been looked upon by all as
the most hopeless are the old timers in State
Prison. Speaking one day in a court-room in
New York on behalf of a man to whom I wanted
the Judge to give a chance and the benefit of
doubt in his case, I was told most definitely by
that gentleman that there was absolutely no hope
for a man who had been more than once in State
Prison. He said, "Mrs. Booth, you may have
some success with the first offenders, but you can
do nothing whatever with those who have been
in prison again and again. They are criminals
born and there is nothing to do for them but to
rearrest them and put them out of harm's way."
This discouraging verdict I have heard from the
lips of many prison officers, police officers and
authorities on criminal questions and so has it
been impressed upon the men that they have
repeatedly assured me that I was wasting my
time upon them. Can anything be imagined
more utterly contradictory to the teaching concerning
the Almighty power of divine grace?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Above all should these be remembered and the
greatest hope and most earnest effort be put
forth by those who would take hope to the
prisoner.</p>

<h2><a name="III_THE_VOLUNTEER_PRISON_LEAGUE" id="III_THE_VOLUNTEER_PRISON_LEAGUE">III<br />
<br />
THE VOLUNTEER PRISON LEAGUE</a></h2>


<p>How small a thing may sometimes all unforeseen
lead to momentous results! How often a
little turn of the tide which some of us call chance
and others Providence, opens up to us new channels
that carry us into unexpected futures! It
was a letter from some of the prisoners in San
Quentin, California, asking me to visit them
during my stay in San Francisco that first led
my steps over the threshold of a state prison.
That day left a deep impression on my heart, and
what I had seen made me long for an opportunity
practically to help the prisoner.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the sea of upturned faces,
many of them so plainly bearing the marring imprint
of sorrow and sin&mdash;despair and misery,&mdash;yet
behind the scars and shadows there was such
an eager longing,&mdash;such a hungry appeal for a
sight of the gleam of Hope's bright star, that one
could but feel an intense inspiration while delivering
the message. Never before had I seen the
stripes,&mdash;never heard the clang behind me of the
iron gates, nor had I realized the hopelessness
that enshrouds the prisoner. It seemed almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
an impertinence for me, coming as I did from a
happy sunlit world, from freedom, friends and
home, to undertake to preach to these into whose
lives I had only just entered and whose thought
and feeling I could so poorly interpret. Is it a
wonder that tears rose more readily to my eyes
than words to my lips, and that it was hard for
me to control either thoughts or voice? I did
not attempt to preach. Undoubtedly their consciences
in many a dark lonely hour had preached
far more pointedly than I could. As far as possible
I tried in that brief hour to carry them
away from prison. I felt it would help them if I
could make them forget where they were, whereas
the emphasizing of their position and condition
might only prove embittering. Stories I had
gathered from the great fragrant book of nature,
or that had come to me from baby lips, I realized
would touch their hearts more swiftly than the
most forcible arguments or convincing condemnations.
The response I read in those upturned
faces&mdash;the grateful words that reached me afterwards
through the mail and the constant memory
of that scene as I witnessed it lasted with me
deepening into a determination to make their
cause mine when the opportunity should offer.</p>

<p>At that time my husband and I were leaders
of the movement known as the Salvation Army.</p>

<p>It would have been impossible to start prison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
work under the hampering influence of regulations
which governed that movement from a
foreign land. When our connection with the
Salvation Army was finally severed, we found
ourselves free to enter new fields.</p>

<p>I wish to make it very clear, as many are often
misled, <i>that our movement has nothing to do with
the Salvation Army, is in no way connected with
it, and is absolutely dissimilar in method and
government</i>. This distinction I venture to emphasize
in order to avoid a confusion that has
frequently occurred in the past.</p>

<p>I wish to go no further into this subject save
to say, that when we severed our connection with
the Salvation Army, it was not the action of impulse
or of disagreement with individuals, but
from conscientious principles and after much
anxious thought and earnest prayer. It was not
easy to begin over again and build up a new
movement. Starting in two small rooms in the
Bible House, with half-a-dozen workers to help
us, and absolutely no capital or source of income
for the work that opened out before us, the Volunteers
had many difficulties to face.</p>

<p>We knew that God's hand was with us, and
now, looking back over the history of the movement
during the seven years of its existence, we
have, indeed, much to be thankful for.</p>

<p>Many have come to feel that one of God's purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
in those leadings that often seem so strange
to us was that this new work in the prisons
might be undertaken.</p>

<p>Though this is but one branch of the work of
the Volunteers of America, which has of course
many other fields in which much blessed success
has been obtained, yet it is the one which fills
perhaps the most needed gap in the defenses of
Christ's Kingdom.</p>

<p>When we designed the new standard of the
movement we placed in the centre of a white
field as our emblem the star of hope. I prayed
then that it might in time be known and loved in
every prison of our land. Though I longed from
the first to undertake this special work for our
country's prisoners, I did not wish to open the
way myself, for with my whole heart I believe
most strongly in Divine guidance and I wished
to be very sure that this was God's work for me.</p>

<p>The Volunteers had only been organized a few
weeks when a letter came from the warden of
Sing Sing asking me to speak there. Another
small thing, but it put into my hands the key to
the future and came unsolicited. I felt that it
was God's answer to my earnest prayer that the
door might be opened. On the 24th of May,
1896, the initial meeting was held, and from that
place and hour it has grown and widened, until
now the movement has attained national proportions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
From Sing Sing the call came to prison
after prison. Sometimes it was a plea sent from
the boys by the chaplain with his request for a
visit added in earnest words. Sometimes it came
from a warden who had heard the testimony of
other wardens as to what had been accomplished
in their prisons. The work was opened in the
following State Prisons&mdash;Sing Sing&mdash;Auburn and
Clinton in New York State&mdash;Charlestown, Mass.,&mdash;Trenton,
New Jersey&mdash;San Quentin and Folsom,
California&mdash;Joliet, Illinois&mdash;Columbus, Ohio&mdash;Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas&mdash;Canon City, Colorado&mdash;Anamosa,
Iowa, and Baltimore, Maryland.</p>

<p>The initial meetings have been held also in
Lansing, Kansas&mdash;Jackson, Michigan&mdash;Fort Madison,
Iowa&mdash;Weathersfield, Connecticut&mdash;Fort
William&mdash;Governor's Island, New York. Yet
there are many, many other prisons from which
most earnest invitations have come to us, which
at present to our great regret have to be denied
for lack of time. Were my shoulders free from
the growing financial burden which has naturally
increased with the development of the work, I
could spend infinitely more time with these who
need me so much and could double the good already
accomplished. It is a wide country and
the breadth of the field and urgency of the need
often make we wish I could be in twenty places
at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>In New York State I owe much to the
loving and able assistance of my dear friend,
Mrs. E. A. McAlpin. She has won a very warm
place in the hearts of the "boys" and constantly
leads my League meetings for me&mdash;spending
hours over interviews with the "boys" in the
prisons of New York. I have around me a devoted
little band of workers who help me in the
outside work, and yet we all feel this longing for
more time, more means, more strength to fill the
great opportunity that has opened before us.
We realize only too keenly that this is but the
small beginning of a great work. Already we
are in touch with some twenty-four thousand
men within the walls, and with a growing number
who are now in the hard struggle to honorably
maintain their regained freedom.</p>

<p>We did not commence the enterprise with any
preconceived ideas, plans or hobbies of our own
to work out. We believed that to be successful
the work must be of natural growth, developing
with circumstances. To plan your methods out
in study or committee room and then to try to
bend the circumstances to your well laid track,
will almost invariably mean failure. All the
plans and measures of the present organization
have been worked out in prison, and that which
I know of the problems I have learned from the
"boys" themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>From the very first I realized that to make the
work effectual there must be the establishment
of personal friendship, and that it was only as we
recognized and helped the individual that we
could by degrees affect the whole population.
They needed friendship and the touch of human
sympathy far more than preachment or argument.
To thus help them practically we had of
course to know the men that we might enter as
much as possible into their lives, so that we could
meet them on a more intimate footing than that
of lecturer and audience&mdash;preacher and congregation.
The only way in which one can really
understand a man's life is to meet him on the
level. We commenced with the chapel services,
talking to the men collectively in a strain that
would make them feel and realize the faith and
hope we felt for them. Then I expressed my
willingness to correspond with all those who had
no friends to write to. The many letters which
reached me as a consequence soon gave us an
insight into the thoughts and feelings of the men
and we were then able to become familiar with
the names and histories of many of them. After
this we could follow up our correspondence with
personal interviews. It was wonderful how the
hearts of the men were touched and opened to
us. In no field have I found a quicker and
deeper response to the message delivered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
there has certainly been time now to prove that
it was not a mere passing emotion or revival enthusiasm,
but that a deep and lasting work was
being accomplished.</p>

<p>As men began to take the decisive step and
declared their intention to lead a different life it
became evident that organization would be wise
to band them together and to enable them to
show their colors in a way that would strengthen
and safeguard them, helping them to be a
constant example to others. To meet this need
we started the V.P.L. or <span class="smcap">Volunteer Prison
League</span>. It is a very simple banding together in
each prison of those who stand for right living
and good discipline. Each member has a certificate
of membership which reads as follows:</p>

<p>"This is to certify that &mdash;&mdash; is a
member of the Volunteer Prison League having
faithfully promised with God's help to conform
to the following conditions of membership:</p>

<p>First&mdash;to pray every morning and night.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;to read the Day Book faithfully.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;to refrain from the use of bad language.</p>

<p>Fourth&mdash;to be faithful in the observance of
prison rules and discipline so as to become
an example of good conduct.</p>

<p>Fifth&mdash;to earnestly seek to cheer and encourage
others in well-doing and right living, trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
where it is possible to make new members
of the League."</p>

<p>This document is hung in the prison cell and
as the man pins on his coat the badge of the
order, a small white button with the blue star in
its centre and the motto of our League in
red lettering&mdash;"Look up and Hope"&mdash;he becomes
at once a marked man. He is watched
by officers and men alike and that very fact is in
itself a reminder to him in the hour of temptation
of the obligations he has taken upon himself.
When the League has attained some size
it becomes a post and the white standard is presented.
Their loving loyalty to the flag is very
clearly seen among the men by the way in which
they earnestly try to live up to the principles it
represents. Often in my letters I read such sentiments
as this&mdash;"Little Mother, as I entered the
chapel Sunday and looked at our white flag, I
thought again of the promises I had made, of all
they ought to mean, and I promised God that
with His help I would never disgrace it. No
one shall see anything in my life that could
bring dishonor or stain to its whiteness."</p>

<p>Naturally there is quite a bond of union among
these League men and it exists not between
those in the one prison alone, but is a link
of prayer and fellowship, and sometimes almost
produces healthy rivalry between prison and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
prison as each Post wishes to keep the best
record. The thought that has made this League
a strong foundation for the work and that has
proved the most rousing inspiration to the men
is that the work is not ours but theirs. No
philanthropist, preacher or teacher in the world
can reform these men. An influence from without
may prove very helpful but it is from within
that the true reform movement must start. The
whole key of this great question, the real solution
of the problem lies within the prisons. It rests
with the men themselves. We can bring them
hope, can help them with our sympathy, can
stimulate their ambition and effort, but they
must "work out their own salvation." In the
League they are made to realize this very
keenly; the responsibility is rolled back upon
their own shoulders. They cease to think that
people must pick them out from their difficulties
or that some turn of fortune's wheel must come
to place them in happier circumstances, before
they can become truly honest and upright.
They realize that they must fight their own
battle,&mdash;commence to rebuild their character,
wresting from adverse circumstances every good
lesson and using every chance they can gain
to raise themselves from the pit into which they
have fallen. Of course we lay the greatest stress
on the need of Divine help. We know from repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
experiences that the "boys" must be
transformed in heart and nature by the spirit of
God if they are to be truly successful, but we believe
that God helps the man whom He sees willing
and anxious to help himself. Nowhere in the
Bible do we find that people can drift lazily into
the kingdom of heaven. Christian life must be
an earnest warfare of watchful struggle in which
every faculty of the man is sincerely engaged.
Since the starting of the League we have enrolled
nearly fourteen thousand men within
prison walls. We have found their interest in
the work intense, and as news of it has spread
from prison to prison even before our coming to
them, the "boys" have learned to look upon it
as their special work and have longingly waited
to welcome that which they have come to feel
will mean the dawning of a new hope for the
future. To try and convey to you something of
this feeling of possession on the part of the men
that have prepared our way in prison after prison,
I turn back to an old diary of mine and quote
from its pages the notes on the opening of
our work at Dannemora&mdash;November 22d, 1896.</p>

<p>"It was a dark, windy night, heavy snow
clouds had gathered and dark shadows lay
around the prison wall. Long rows of electric
lights gleamed steadily through the gloom and
the absolute stillness was unbroken. Right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
there by my window I knelt and prayed for the
many we should soon see and learn to know;
prayed that the 22d of November might be
as memorable a day as the 24th of May, the
27th of September, the 17th of October and
other red letter days in prison which I might
mention.</p>

<p>All through that night the snow fell and Dannemora
presented a pretty winter scene when we
looked out of our windows Sunday morning.
Clouds were still in the sky, but streaks of silver
light and pale primrose tints behind the mountain
range and patches of blue here and there
showed that fair weather was triumphing. The
icicles hung in long, glittering fringes from
the roofs of the prison buildings and the crust of
the snow in the prison yard gleamed with frost
brilliants. As the hour of service approached
we entered the prison and waited in the warden's
office until the word came that all was ready.</p>

<p>How can I describe what followed and the
sight that greeted me? Loving hands had for
four weeks been decorating the chapel. Two
thousand yards of evergreen trimming was
wreathed and festooned on pillars and walls.
Flags, shields, mottoes had been beautifully
draped and designed and the blending of the
national colors with the Volunteer standard was
graceful and effective. Over the door through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
which I entered was the word "welcome" surmounted
by an eagle on a drapery of the two
flags. As we passed up the aisle escorted by the
warden, the chapel was packed, all the "boys"
being present, save those who had charge of the
boilers, and the men in the condemned
cells.</p>

<p>The audience was very still as I entered, but
the moment I mounted the flower-decked platform
they burst into an enthusiastic welcome.
What a sight it was, that great sea of eager faces,
amid the setting of colors and greenery! I wish
I could give you a picture of the chapel as I saw
it, but you must paint it in your own mind and
when I tell you it was the most beautifully decorated
building I have been in, you can realize
how much loving thought and toil it represented.
Is it a wonder my heart was deeply touched?
Who was I, to receive such marks of love and
honor? A stranger to all but three in that community,
and yet they opened their hearts to me
as their friend, even before they had heard my
voice. I think they had learned already that I
loved them, that I believed in a future of hope
for them and that God had formed a bond of understanding
and sympathy between us.</p>

<p>I cannot describe the meeting. The band
played superbly, the singing was hearty, the interest
and enthusiasm were intense, and to me the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
faces of my audience with their ever changing
expressions were a perfect inspiration. Then
came the solemn closing minutes. Tears had
flowed freely, hearts had been moved by the influence
of God's own Spirit and now a hush
seemed to fall and one could feel and see the
struggle going on in many hearts.</p>

<p>Clearly and definitely understanding all that it
meant, one after another arose. It was all I could
do to control my feelings. The chaplain was in
tears: many of the officers were weeping, and,
with bowed heads, men were rising all over the
place, until eighty-seven stood in God's presence,
seeking the light and cleansing and liberty that
He alone can give.</p>

<p>God was there. We could feel His presence,
and the light came down and shone on some of
those tear stained faces until they were almost
transfigured.</p>

<p>When all was over, they had gone back to
their cells, and I stood at the window of my room
looking out at the snow, over which now the sun
shone, my heart was very thankful, and the words
seem to come to my mind with new force
"though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as
white as snow"; and looking up at the sky,
where the sun had triumphed and chased away
the clouds, the blessed promise "I have blotted
out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
cloud thy sins," came to my heart with a fresh
wave of comfort.</p>

<p>The afternoon was a busy one with interviews,
and in the evening I was again fully occupied.
What a glorious night that was! The brilliant
moon smiled down upon the snow-clad country
making it glitter with a myriad frost diamonds.
As we looked out upon the prison buildings from
our windows, it was a very different scene from
the night before. Everything looked so bright,
so pure, so peaceful. The dark shadows, the
heavy clouds, the fitful wind had given place to
calm and silver light. So I think in some of the
hearts that were that night speaking to God
within those prison walls peace and light had
triumphed, and the shadows and gloom had fled
away. I sometimes wonder if my friends realize
that I am thinking of them. I wonder if they
know how near I am to them in heart and thought
all the time I am at the prison.</p>

<p>I had intended to leave early Monday morning,
but the warden persuaded me to remain over and
take the night train. The whole day was spent
in interviews, which kept me right up to the moment
the carriage was at the door and I had to
tear myself away. This enabled me to have a
little personal talk with seventy-six men.</p>

<p>I was very much touched by a mark of appreciation
of our work shown by a number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
men who subscribed nearly one hundred dollars
out of the money they had on deposit towards
our Hope Hall fund. Does not this show how
truly they appreciate our plans and schemes and
efforts for their future? I think this should make
the fortunate and wealthy outside the prison eager
to follow their example in generous and loving
sympathy with the good work. The officers of
the prison among themselves subscribed fifty-five
dollars as a testimony of their indorsement of the
movement.</p>

<p>From men all over the country, in prisons not
yet visited, comes the plea to go to them and my
heart longs to answer it, but so far we have had
to go slowly.</p>

<p>I was visiting recently for the first time a new
prison, and was much touched by a remark made
by one of the men to the chaplain. He is serving
a life term and has proved himself to be an
earnest Christian. Meeting the chaplain the day
before my expected visit he said, "Chaplain,
when there is some special request I have made
in prayer, I write it down and when the answer
comes, I put O.K. against the prayer. To-day I
can do that again, for I have prayed so long that
the Little Mother might come to us, and at last
my prayer is answered." Is it a wonder that my
heart turns longingly to the great wide field where
the harvest awaits us, to the many whose call to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
us is as clear as ever the Macedonian call could
be from heathen lands?</p>

<p>Alas, all too much of my time has to be filled
with money-raising lectures, so that long lecture-trips
for this purpose keep me from the work
where I know I could do so much to cheer and
comfort these waiting hearts.</p>

<p>We do not want our labors in the prisons to be
a mere evangelizing effort, but we wish to establish
a permanent work, and hence of course we
have had to move slowly. On the other hand
the effect has been much more lasting. How
much it has meant of cheer and sunshine to the
men, can only be realized as we gather from day
to day the news that comes to us from all over
the country. It must be remembered how shut
off these men are from friendship, from the world,
from all matters of interest that can carry them
out of their dull, dreary routine in cell and workshop
life, to understand what this link with the
outer world has proved to many of them. We
send to each prison a large number of <i>Volunteers'
Gazettes</i>, the official organ of our movement and
its pages are read with deepest interest giving, as
they do, news of progress of each prison League,
and also constant reports of the successes of men
once their fellow-prisoners, who are now living
free and honest lives in the path that lies before
them also. They look forward intensely to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
League meetings. The whole tendency of the
work is to stir up a new interest in life.</p>

<p>When one thinks of the men who are incarcerated
for a lifetime, many of whom have perhaps
outlived all ties of friendship and relationship,
one can gain some idea of the help it proves
to them in enduring their position, to realize that
they belong to something and some one, and can
still look for bright spots in the monotony of
prison life.</p>

<p>The question may be raised as to the relationship
of this work to the labors of the chaplains
in state prison. I want it most emphatically
understood that in all things our wish is to work
harmoniously with prison officers, not only with
the spiritual advisers, but also the wardens, and
so far we have had the greatest help and sympathy
from them. Our work could not be construed
into a reflection on that of the chaplain.
It is to help and to back up his efforts, to bring
in an outside influence which I have found the
chaplain most ready to welcome, a link to the
outside world. The chaplain is of necessity of
the prison world and though he has a splendid
sphere for helping and blessing the men while
under his charge, he cannot go with them into
the new life. We may come in and form a
friendship and tie to which they can turn after
the chaplain has bidden them farewell, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
are once more facing life's battle on the outside.
In almost all the prisons where the V.P.L. has
been established, the chaplains have most cordially
welcomed us and are working heart and
hand with us, some of them even wearing the
little League button and becoming officially associated
with the movement.</p>

<p>Chaplain Barnes of Massachusetts has an experience
of twenty-three years of devoted toil for
the "boys" and he has often told me he feels
that a new era has come to the spiritual life of
our prisons through the establishing of the V.P.L.
It has been wonderfully interesting to us
to watch the spiritual growth in grace, and the
mental and moral development of the men after
they have started in the new life. Often the
most unlikely have seemed suddenly to wake up
and develop possibilities never dreamed of by
those who had known them before. As letter
after letter has come to me from such I have felt
as if I could read here the unfolding of a better
nature long dormant, between the lines so simply
and naturally telling of struggles and victories in
the passing days. I have seen over and over the
birth and growth of a soul.</p>

<p>Just recently a little Day Book came into my
hands by chance, and knowing what I do of the
owner, its record is a very pathetic glimpse into
a heart story. He was by no means a first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
offender but an inmate of the prison of the old
timers, Dannemora. Burglary had been his
special line and he had started in it quite young,
as did his brother whose story I shall tell elsewhere.
My first acquaintance with him was an
urgent letter entreating me to care for his wife
and little one, who, he feared from news just
received, were facing dire need. My interest in
them evidently touched a tender chord in his
heart for he became one of my warm friends and
champions, though at that time neither a Christian
nor a League member. Many of the men
who make no profession of being good are still
most heartily with us in sentiment, and I have
been looked upon as the "Little Mother" and
stood up for as loyally by these as by our own
V.P.L. "boys." As time went on and this man
came more and more under the influence of the
work, he began to weigh well his future and at last
took his stand with good determination for the
new life. When he joined the League I gave
him this little book which all our boys are supposed
to read together each morning and night.
Five years afterwards it came into my hands by
accident and I read what he had written on the
fly leaf the day he had received it. "In accepting
this little book I do so with a firm determination
and a promise to try and live faithfully a
better and purer life with God's help." Underneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
his name and number are signed, and then
the words "seven years and six months" chronicled
the length of his sentence. Turning the
leaves I found one verse marked that had evidently
proved his greatest comfort, "The Lord is
not slack concerning His promise as some men
count slackness, but is long-suffering to usward
not willing that any should perish but that all
should come to repentance." Then came the
record of the passing days and years, marked off
at the head of different daily portions blending
the interests near and dear to his heart and
future, with his daily devotion. "I am twenty-nine
years old to-day," headed July 21st. On
July 27th, "My wife is twenty-three years old
to-day," and yet later on the same page three
years after he chronicled, "My wife is twenty-six."
In the shadow of that cell the baby face
with golden curls came often to smile upon him
in fancy and on one page we find "My little girl
is two years old, 1897." In prison the days pass
all too slowly. We find on another page May
2d, "Eight hundred and fourteen days more."
Further on "Five hundred and seventy-two days
more," then "three hundred and sixty-five days
more" and yet again "two hundred and seventy"
is marked and then the last entry "I go home
to-day, July 27, 1901." So the Day Book, his
little companion and guide, held on its pages the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
record of the passing days in which he was preparing
for the future. I knew something of the
fierce struggle he had with old habits, evil
temper, past memories and disappointments that
had to be faced, for during those prison days I
sometimes talked with him personally, but I also
know how he conquered and how truly he came
out "a new man in Christ Jesus." He thought
he was coming to a glad, bright, joyous experience
on his discharge and was met by a blow
and sorrow that would have staggered many a
stronger man. I cannot chronicle the awful test
through which this soul passed, for there are
confidences that cannot be betrayed even to
show the keeping grace of the new life, but I
can say this, he manfully stood the trial and is
to-day a happy, earnest, honest, Christian man.
He has proved himself a good husband and a
most tenderly devoted father. He works hard
all day, receiving excellent wages and in the
evening walks or reads with his little girl. He
has a bright, well furnished home and over a
thousand dollars in the bank laid by for a rainy
day. He has never returned to the saloon or in
any way mixed with the old life which he considers
buried with the dead self, for truly he is
living in a new world after a veritable resurrection.</p>

<p>The little Day Book has proved a great comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
to many. At first we used to send a copy
to every League member, though now regretfully
we have had to desist, because we could not
afford it with the great increase in membership.
Many of our "boys" had never taken any interest
in the Bible before and some are as indifferent
and ignorant as the heathen abroad, but this
"Daily Light" collection of passages has been to
them a veritable revelation. Many feel towards
it as one "boy" wrote to me, "As I kneel down
to pray and read before going to the workshop
in the morning it seems as if my Saviour sent me
a direct message to guide and warn me through
the trials of the day, and at night when I come
in tired and read again, I find a message of comfort
and a promise from Him that cheers and encourages
my heart." The writer of these words
died in prison a triumphantly happy death, leaving
behind him a record, the truth of which
every officer could attest, of earnest Christian living
after having at one time been the terror of
the prison, for from childhood he had been absolutely
ignorant of the first rudiments of goodness
and Christianity.</p>

<p>The following verses were sent by one of our
League members and were penned in a prison
cell. They give an insight into the thought and
feeling of many another man who cannot perhaps
as readily express himself in verse.</p>

<p>If the record of successful work in prison were
written only in numerical report one might still
have many misgivings as to its success. There
is only one thing that really tells in Christian
work either in prison or on the outside and that
is <i>the life</i>. Theory can be questioned, argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
can be refuted, profession doubted, creed quibbled
over, but a life that can be seen and read of all
men is testimony beyond criticism.</p>

<p>I remember after we had been working in Sing
Sing six months an officer called me on one side
and speaking very earnestly of the work, he said,
"I want to confess to you that I was one who
took no stock in this movement at first. I used
to laugh at the men making a profession of living
any better. I looked upon it as so much religious
nonsense, but I confess I have been forced
to change my views. You do not know the
change it has made in this prison and the miracles
that have been wrought in many of these
men. You can see them in the meetings and
can judge of them by their letters, but we live
with them day after day and know far more than
you can. I never believed anything could take
hold of the whole prison population, the educated,
the middle class and the tougher element affecting
them equally as this work has done." Then
he added, "There was one 'boy' in my company
who was the foulest-mouthed man I have ever
met. He used an oath with almost every word
and was so criminal and evil that we never
dreamed he could be anything else. The absolute
reformation in that man is what opened my
eyes. That was not talk but reality."</p>

<p>Perhaps the strongest testimony we could offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
as to the effect of the work on prison discipline,
comes from the pens of our well-known wardens.
Speaking before the quarterly meeting of the
Iowa State Board of Control, Major McClaughry,
late of Joliet, Ill., now Warden of the Federal
Prison at Fort Leavenworth, said:</p>

<p>"I wish to add a word in relation to influences
in the prison that I have found most helpful.
Some years ago, Mrs. Booth came to the prison
to speak to the prisoners. She first had interviews
with some of the men which I permitted
rather reluctantly, but I soon noticed her wonderful
personal influence over the men she talked
with. When later she spoke to the prisoners in
chapel, and they were greatly interested in her
presentation without cant or denominational
prejudice, of the best way to live. I asked her
to come again and she came. That time she organized
with us what is known as the 'Volunteer
Prison League' an association of men, who, realizing
what is before them band themselves together
and wear the button of the League&mdash;which
requires a great deal of bravery in a prison
like Joliet. The promise to them was, that so
long as they followed the motto of the League
and looked upward and not down, forward and
not back, and helped one another, they should be
recognized as a force in the prison itself making
for good order and constituted authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"I entered upon the experiment, as I say, with
a good deal of apprehension, but I am glad to
say that it proved to be one of the most potent
forces inside of the prison to secure not only
cheerful obedience and compliance with the rules
and regulations of the prison, but a force that co-operated
with the authorities of the prison in the
direction of law and order. Wherever that
League has been established, while it has gone
up and down and had its vicissitudes, like the
early church, it has proved most helpful in every
respect, and its influence upon the individual
men, no person not familiar with its workings
can for a moment imagine. Therefore I feel that
the Volunteer Prison League, properly managed,
is one of the most beneficent institutions that can
be introduced into prison life."</p>

<p>This testimony is all the more forceful when
we remember that the one speaking has been a
prison warden for some twenty-eight years and
has also served as Chief of Police in Chicago.
He certainly should know of what he speaks.</p>

<p>I opened the work in Dannemora, New York
State, where Warden Thayer welcomed me most
courteously, did all in his power both in his own
home and in the prison, to make me feel at
home, but being frank and outspoken he thought
it well to impress me with the hopelessness of
my task. He said briefly that no obstacle should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
stand in my way as far as he was concerned, but
he did not want to see me heart-broken over a
work that he foresaw could never succeed. He
told me clearly his opinion and advised me not
to try the impossible. After watching the work,
however, he became one of my stanch supporters
and has repeatedly championed our cause where
the usefulness of such work has been questioned.</p>

<p>At a public meeting in New York, he told a
story on himself of which I was up to that time
ignorant. Speaking of our first enrollment of
men in prison, he said, "When I saw those men,
one hundred and seven of them, stand up, I began
to feel sorry for Mrs. Booth. Here were the
very hardest men I had to deal with in the
prison; men constantly reported for punishment.
I took a list of their names for future reference.
I kept that list in my desk, and when the year
had passed I brought it out with a view of paralyzing
that little woman. Would you credit it?
I learned to my own surprise and satisfaction on
comparing it with the punishment book that out
of those who stood up in the chapel that Sunday
morning, only three had required punishment during
that entire year. I saw now what I had not
realized before, namely, that as an aid to the observance
of discipline of the prison no plans had
ever equalled the influence of this work."</p>

<p>Warden Darby of Columbus, Ohio, writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"The organization of Post No. 10, Volunteer
Prison League in the Ohio Penitentiary, has been
very gratifying to the prisoners, who are looking
forward to a brighter and better future, who are
striving to build a moral foundation that will
withstand the tides of adversity and trial. The
League has been of incalculable benefit, for it has
been directly instrumental in bringing many to
right thinking, an absolutely necessary prelude
to right doing.</p>

<p>"The good derived has not been limited to
the League members alone, others have been induced
to strive for better, higher and nobler
lives. The influence of good will manifest its
usefulness in any community and the rule is
equally applicable on either side of the prison wall.</p>

<p>"The Volunteer Prison League is a factor in
bettering the discipline of its members, since
they who live up to the obligations must strive
to improve their conduct, this being one of the
primary objects of the organization."</p>

<p>Space does not allow the reproduction of the
much that has been said and could be said of
this work which, as I have tried to show, is not
my work but the work of the "boys" themselves,
the result of earnest conquering lives. Undoubtedly
the lesson which men in prison need to
learn almost above any other is that of <i>self-mastery</i>.
Many are there through lack of self-control:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
others have utterly weakened will and
deadened conscience by yielding themselves
slaves to strong drink and yet others have let go
their hold on the reins because, having once
failed, they have allowed the feeling that it is no
use to try again to rob them of courage. Just
on this point their League membership has
proved invaluable. If the new leaf is ever to be
turned over, it should certainly be in prison. In
the early days of our work many men would say
to me as also to my dear friend and fellow-worker,
Mrs. McAlpin, "No, I cannot take my
stand now. It is too hard here, but I am determined
to do right the day of my discharge."
More and more the "boys" are coming to see
how disastrous is such a fallacy. The man who
does not have the courage in prison lacks it as
much in freedom, when faced with the decision
between right and wrong. There are, moreover,
so many pitfalls and temptations awaiting him, to
say nothing of the hard, up-hill road abounding
in disappointments which almost all have to tread,
that if he be not well prepared, failure is almost
inevitable. Before he knows it, even with the
best of intentions in his heart, such a man will
be swept aside and carried away back to the
whirlpool of vice and crime, from which he will
all too quickly, be cast again on to the rocks of
wreck and ruin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>In many ways I have heard of the influence of
the League from unexpected sources. Travelling
in a parlor car in the West on one occasion, I
was introduced by some friends to a judge of the
Supreme Court. In the conversation that followed,
he told me he had heard of our work and
was deeply interested in it. "There is one of
your men," he said, "who has come under my
personal notice and to whose great change of
life I can myself testify. Some years ago I had
to sentence him to State Prison. The man protested
his innocence but there was no doubt in
my mind as to his guilt. After he had become
a member of your League in prison he wrote
me a letter telling of his intention to lead an upright
life in the future. He confessed his guilt
and thanked me for the sentence which he now
looked upon as the best thing that had befallen
him. In due time he came out of prison, found
work, has done well and won the confidence of
those who knew him. Quite recently he wrote
me saying that he had earned money enough to
pay off his debts little by little, until all were discharged
and so far as money could make restitution
he had made it. Now he wanted to know
the cost to the State for his prosecution that he
might pay that also." This desire to make restitution
and to undo past wrongs I have seen constantly,
after the men's consciences had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
awakened, but in no other case have I heard of
it going to the extent of wishing to repay the
State and had I not heard this from the lips of
the judge himself, I should have been inclined to
think it an exaggeration.</p>

<p>Speaking in one of our Volunteer meetings a
short time since a young man testified to the
help the League had been to him in years gone
by. He told our officers that he had been in
prison for a forgery amounting to two thousand
dollars; that on his discharge he had consulted
me and I had advised him to promise the gentleman
whom he had wronged that he would pay
back the amount by degrees. He said further
that he had just succeeded in doing this and was
now a trusted employee of the very man who
had had to prosecute him for crime.</p>

<p>This is not a place to lay bare confessions but
I could give a wonderful story of the many confidences
that have been given to me by hearts
deeply enough touched and truly enough changed
to become quick and sensitive regarding hidden
wrongs that should be righted.</p>

<p>As I have looked over what has already been
accomplished in state prison in its power on the
future of these men and their relation to the
world, I can but realize the safeguarding and
benefit to others of that which tames and controls,
changes and inspires men who might otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
go out into life hardened, imbittered and
more depraved than on the day of their incarceration,
to prey on society and wreak their
vengeance for wrongs real or imaginary.</p>

<h2><a name="IV_THE_POWER_BEHIND_THE_WORK" id="IV_THE_POWER_BEHIND_THE_WORK">IV<br />
<br />
THE POWER BEHIND THE WORK</a></h2>


<p>In the bright fragrance of a spring morning
our long, heavy train of cars wound its way
slowly up the Divide. The track curved and
doubled back and forth amid the forest like
some great brown silver-streaked serpent; here
gliding into the earth to be lost in the blackness
of a tunnel, there, flinging itself over a dizzy
chasm spanned only at fabulous cost by a feat
of engineering. Higher, ever higher we rose
until a glorious view of valley swept below us
from the forest fringe to Ashland. At the summit
came a pause for breath and then the long,
dark, suffocating tunnel, and after it the sight
that one would gladly cross a continent to see,
as we beheld it in all the glory of brilliant sunshine
and bluest ether. Below us stretched a
great plain, a veritable green ocean of prairie.
To one side the ridge of rugged forest-clad
mountains that form the great Divide. Away
ahead like high rocky islands in the emerald sea
rose the dark steep Buttes backed by the spires
and turreted peaks of the Castle Rocks.</p>

<p>But all this was only a setting for the jewel, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
less beautiful, above which towered in queenly
majesty the glory of the Sierras, Shasta. As we
first saw her, it seemed impossible to believe
that the gleaming majestic mass of whiteness
belonged to earth. She seemed to be a great
white cloud on the horizon, shimmering against
the pale-blue ether, resting but for a moment on
the rock-bounded forest that swept from the
plain to form her base. As we slowly wound
our way down to the valley, as we glided in and
out and round about over the plain, we gazed
for hours at this most wonderful of mountains,
our eyes fascinated, our lips silent, our hearts
stirred by the wonder of her quiet, queenly grandeur.
At first she dazzled us in the full glory of
the sunlight as her snows shone against a vivid
blue sky, then as the sun sank to the ridge
opposite, the background changed to palest
green and her whiteness was stained with crimson
and touched with gold, growing richer and
deeper every moment. Darkness began to
gather in the valley; the woods grew mysterious
with gloom; purple shadows crept up to
the timber-line and even dared to steal over her
snowy base, but the head of Shasta still glowed
and blushed with the glory of the setting sun.
At last he was lost to us over the ridge and the
swift twilight claimed the whole land, but watching
still the mountain heights above us, we saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
yet another change. Shasta was transfigured!
The pale primrose of the after-glow shone over
all her pure whiteness and from a queen of glory
she seemed changed to the sweet loyalty of a
loving heart that held the sacred memory of the
beloved long after he was lost to other eyes.</p>

<p>Night found us creeping downwards in the
solemn darkness of the chasm on the further
side. Great fir trees, giant sentinels of the
forest closed in about us and that strange, silent
mystery of mountain solitudes reigned supreme.
Looking backwards, we could still catch glimpses
of the centre peak behind us, shining serenely
white now beneath the silvery moonbeams,
which had not strength to penetrate the dense
forest that clothed the gorge. Leaning over the
edge of the observation car, I had become so
absorbed in communion with nature that it was
startling to be aroused by a voice at my side. A
fellow-passenger was calling my attention to
something away down beneath us in the abyss
which seemed to me to hold nothing but impenetrable
blackness. As my eyes became used
to the obscurity, however, I could distinguish a
little silver line amid the rocks and though at
first I could hear only the creaking of the trestle
bridge beneath us and the labored breathing of
our great locomotive, I distinguished at last the
far-away silvery music of a tiny mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
stream. It struck me as strange that I should
have my attention called to this little brook when
I had seen so many glorious streams and rivers
in my overland journeys. The explanation however
gave reason enough as my friend announced,
"That is the Sacramento at its source. During
the night we shall cross it twenty-seven or
twenty-eight times and to-morrow you will see
it very differently when we cross it for the last
time."</p>

<p>All through that night I watched the growth
of the little stream. At first it was narrow and
shallow and its voice but a silvery song as it
threaded its way amid the rocks or sent a spray
of mist and foam over the moss when some obstruction
barred its way. But by and by it grew
to be a rushing torrent, the double note of power
and purpose dominated its song, and as the train
thundered over bridge after bridge, I saw it dashing
and crashing over its rugged bed, here leaping
a precipice, there rushing with wave-white
fury against some mighty rock, tossing great logs
from side to side as if they were straws. Ever
onward, forward, downward, drawing with it
every lesser stream, engulfing every waterfall and
spring, it kept us company through the long,
moonlit night and then in the broad daylight, we
crossed it for the last time and saw it in the
might of its accomplished strength. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
great ferry-boat bore our heavy train over the
river, I looked out upon a deep broad placid expanse
of blue water. Sunbeams played with the
myriad ripples powdering the turquoise with
gold. Fertile foothills rolled away on either side
and looking far off to the horizon the mighty
river joined the bay, and yet further lost itself
through the Golden Gate in the mighty Western
ocean. Broad enough, deep enough, strong
enough to carry a nation's fleet upon its breast,
that is what the streamlet of the wilderness had
become. What mighty lessons Nature teaches
us!</p>

<p>I have carried my readers far away to California
and surely might be accused of wandering
from my point, but I wanted to tell them of a
voice that has been a blessed cheer and inspiration
to my heart, reminding me in hours of difficulty
and discouragement of the great Source of
all strength and power. Had a critic paused in
faithless speculation by the side of the little Sacramento
in its rocky cradle days up there in the
wilderness, he might have interrupted its silvery
song with a jarring note of discouragement.
"Foolish little stream," the critic might have
said, "what are you singing about so joyously?
Do you tell of the thirsty you are going to cool,
of the wilderness that shall blossom at your touch,
of the great valleys you are going to fertilize?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Are you dreaming of ships you would carry, of
the long miles you would travel, of the great
ocean upon whose breast you would cast yourself?
How absurd and unlikely are these day
dreams! Look at yourself! See how tiny and
insignificant you are, so narrow that a child could
leap over you, so shallow that I can see the very
pebbles in your bed. It is a foolish fancy, impossible
of realization. You had better stop singing,
you will only dry up and be absorbed by the
ferns and moss of the forest; that will be the
easiest, happiest end for you." If the stream had
thought it worth while to respond, I know the
answer that would have rung out clear and sweet,
for this is the message it sang to my heart,
"Yes, of myself I may be small and insignificant.
The distance and obstacles may be far and formidable.
I may of myself be too weak to face
them, but look behind me, at the snows of
Shasta; think of the springs and water courses
that gush from her eternal rocks and remember
that my help comes from the hills and when
thus helped, I too can become mighty."</p>

<p>In the early days of the work, it seemed an
overwhelming undertaking to meet the great sad
problem that faced us within the walls of State
Prison. There was indeed a great desert representing
thirst and need, wreck and ruin. Many
tried to discourage us by painting in vivid colors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the difficulties of the undertaking, and I grant
they cannot be very easily exaggerated, for where
vice and sin, human weakness and life's misfortunes
have swept over mankind, the problem is
one of the most overwhelming that can be faced.
The work was spoken of as an experiment and a
very doubtful one at that, and if it had been some
new plan for the reforming of criminals, some
mere exertion of human influence or the hobby
and scheme of an organization that was to be
tried, one might well have been faint-hearted.
We, however, have felt from the first and now
feel more intensely than ever that this undertaking
has not been our work, but God's work.
We can truly say we are not attempting it in our
own strength but we "lift up our eyes unto the
hills, from whence cometh our help," and to
every doubter and critic we answer, "God does
not experiment." His work succeeds; His
building stands; His touch transforms. Were it
not for this, what heart should we have in dealing
with those who have made trial of other help
and strength and found it to fail them?</p>

<p>Many of the men to whom we go are defiled
with the leprosy of sin. They have tried self-purification,
and effort after effort has failed them.
What could we say to them unless we believed
that the Voice that said of old, "Be thou clean,"
could say it as truly to-day? We deal with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
who are truly blind as to things spiritual, and no
human hands could open these sightless eyes, no
human voice could unstop the ears of the spiritually
deaf. There we must deal with souls and
consciences dead to right, unconscious of the responsibilities
and possibilities of life, and we
know that only the Divine Hand that raised the
dead can quicken them again. We have realized
and acknowledged this from the first, so our
work is not to be a moral education or a recommendation
tending to the turning over of a new
leaf, but we have sought ever to point the souls
in darkness to the true light and those wrestling
with their own sin and weakness to the wondrous
power of God.</p>

<p>Too often are we met when pleading with men
to rise up and make a brave effort to do right,
with the discouraging answer, "I have tried and
failed," and each effort that proved fruitless has
robbed them of the courage to try again. While
we do not for a moment discount the vital importance
of personal effort, of good resolves, of
will exerted in the right direction, we try most
clearly to show the need of seeking God's help,
showing that when the man would start out on
the road, it is of the utmost importance to <i>start
right</i>. Feeling as we do, we have naturally been
filled with hope and courage for our work. We
do not have to look for difficulties, we need not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
be overwhelmed by our own weakness or inefficiency;
nothing is too hard for God. No obstacle
can stand before Him. So from the first
we have been full of faith and joy in battle and
have not been disappointed for victory after
victory has come to add inspiration to our
efforts.</p>

<p>We believe that the great Father-heart feels
intense pity and divine compassion for the one
who has strayed and fallen. Surely no child of
God can doubt this. It has seemed to us that
the time has come when that passage of Scripture
is being fulfilled, "For He hath looked down
from the height of His sanctuary; from heaven
did the Lord behold the earth, to hear the groaning
of the prisoner, to loose those that are
appointed to death." One can but be a believer
in the miracles of old when faced with the miracles
of to-day, where the fetters that have bound
some souls have been snapped, and men have
been delivered from the power of opium, of
strong drink and other vices after they had been
given up as utterly beyond redemption. During
these years of work in prison, onlookers have
acknowledged to me over and over again, that
they have been forced to recognize some superhuman
power when they have seen lives transformed.
From watching at first with indifference
or skeptical criticism, they have come at last to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
look upon the work with absolute faith, even
though personally they have had no knowledge
of the wonderful power at work.</p>

<p>Let me give you in his own words the abbreviated
sketch of the life of one of God's miracles:</p>

<p>"Everything looked fair for me as life lay all
in front; money, education, social standing were
mine. Loving parents and sweet surroundings
beautified life, but alas they counted for nothing
in one sense. Before I was twenty-one I flung
all that was good to the winds, took my life into
my own hands and decided to do as I pleased; I
did so. Why, if there was any reason, it is immaterial
now. Surely there should not have
been. I left all who could help me and when
twenty-two years of age found myself in a
strange country, with all the tastes and ideas of
one who had been gently raised, but without
means to gratify them. To work I was not able,
to beg I could not, so from being a lamb I
gradually became a wolf. I realized that in
order to succeed I must learn to keep cool, I
must face life desperately. As I lived in the far
West mostly, I had to acquire skill in the use of
weapons and I was also an expert horseman.
There was no other career open to me but the
army. To my nature and character, there was
no other safe place except prison. I did well
while in the service, but the dissatisfaction in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
heart drove me often to excesses that gained a
hold over me that constantly threw me down.
Yielding to evil and despising myself for it, had
the effect of hardening and embittering me;
though I committed many lawless deeds, I generally
managed to protect myself from consequences,
never being caught for the worst things,
and though I have known the inside of several
prisons in the long years of my wanderings I
have only served nine years, which, compared to
what I might have had, seems small punishment.
Once I escaped while in double irons and had it
not been for that escape I might have died in
the miserable suffering I was then enduring. I
had to make a hundred miles on foot through
desert country without food or water, and the
third day I faced death having only just strength
enough to reach the desired goal. I went
through a term in one of the hardest prisons of
this country years ago, when men suffered there
indescribably and it was there that I took to
opium, because I found it makes men forget and
by its use you can still the anguish of remorse.
A few years after that I served as Chief of Police
in one of the districts of Alaska, then under
martial law and the hard school through which I
had passed gave me the stern recklessness of life
necessary for such a post. The opium which I
still used I took scientifically and was able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
keep my own counsel in all things. The first
five years of the drug were comfortable, the
second five it lost its happy effect. I had commenced
to use the hypodermic needle and morphine,
because of the quicker action of this
method. During this period I was a soldier of
fortune in South America, Mexico and Central
America. I was a hospital steward in the Army,
Sergeant Major in a regiment, First Sergeant of
a Company and I was able to hold my own and
fulfill my duties and yet I was becoming scarred
from head to foot with the use of the hypodermic
needle. After this I was reckless and careless
as to my own life and I never knew, when
the sun rose, whether I would live to see it set. I
became wholly indifferent as to the consequences
of my life, careless and reckless as to my actions.
Then came an imprisonment, out of which I
came back into the world a wreck. I made a
desperate effort and managed to rehabilitate myself
and once more held a good position in life,
but unable to break from the bondage of the evil
habit that behind everything held me in thralldom,
I was once more dragged down and was
led to commit deed after deed that I otherwise
should have scorned. I have used as many as
sixty grains of morphine and thirty grains of
cocaine, during these miserable days of slavery.</p>

<p>Then came my last two years of imprisonment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
I was looked upon as a hard and desperate man
in the prison, one who could not be reached or
influenced in any way. One day I was sent for
to the front office of the prison. The messenger
said, 'A lady wants to see you.' 'Not me,' I
replied, 'no one wants to see me; it is a mistake.'
But it was not. To my surprise I found
Mrs. McAlpin had sent for me. 'Twas almost a
shock for I had no visitors and it was long since
I had talked to a lady. Then came a never-to-be-forgotten
meeting in the chapel, when the
words spoken thrilled in my heart; I felt for
once that I was compelled to stop and think. I
had made many plans of what my future was to be,
but they were plans of evil design. I had decided
that my apprenticeship was served, that I ought
to be able to do a master's work so I had determined
never to stand for an arrest again. But
I deliberately planned a coup that if successful
would place me beyond the necessity for such
things and if a failure, I had determined never to
be taken alive. Then the Little Mother came
and spoilt all my plans; as I heard her talk, I
felt she was putting me out of business; she was
putting me in the wrong. Shortly after this I
was removed to a new cell and on a shelf in the
corner I came upon a piece of paper; it was
a partly torn piece of the <i>Volunteers' Gazette</i>
smeared with whitewash. It had evidently been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
pasted on a cell wall once, but had become detached
and had been thrown up upon the shelf
and there had been overlooked. It was difficult
to decipher, but with care I made out these
words that I have never forgotten. They were
in an old message from the pen of our Leader to
her 'boys.' 'If I can afford to face difficulties
and yet go on with a faith that wavers not, you
can also. So let us look up and hope, taking a
firm hold of the strong arm of God and looking
for courage to the stars of eternal promise that
shine on above the clouds and mists of earth.'</p>

<p>"Do not think all the good things came at
once. They did not. It took a long time to
build up the edifice on the site of the old ruins.
Alone I certainly should have failed and the last
end would have been overwhelmingly worse
than the first, but God's help is almighty and the
'I trust you' of His messenger meant everything."</p>

<p>Facing a stern struggle on his discharge this
man proved strong enough to withstand. The
old vices were abandoned. He took the sharp
turn to the right that goes up the steep mountain
side to the purer, clearer altitudes where we can
walk in the light and enjoy the sunshine of God's
approving smile. With wonder was the news
received in prison, month after month, year after
year that he was standing firm. To-day he is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
worker at my side, a strength and comfort to
many another soul and a messenger of blessing
in the many poor and sad homes that he visits.
A little while since he returned to the prison
where he had paced so often back and forth,
back and forth through the weary hours of
struggle in the narrow little cell. As he talked
to the men who had known him, as he gave his
thrilling message before the officers who had
doubted the possibility of his reformation, he
appeared to them as one who had gone into
a new country and returned with tidings, not so
much of the giants that dwelt there as of the
milk and honey and fruits of peace and happiness
which awaited those who in their turn
would venture over the dividing line.</p>

<p>On one of my visits to Trenton, the warden
told me of a man whose change of life was so remarkable
that it had become the talk of the
prison. He had been the most treacherous and
dangerous of the prison population. Every
officer agreed that he could never be trusted and
for insubordination and violence they had never
known his equal. After his conversion he was
so quiet, amenable to discipline, cheerful and
helpful in his attitude to others and at all times
consistent in living up to his profession that his
life made the most profound impression. In
speaking of him to me the warden said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
it was nothing short of a miracle, and that the
work was well worth while if only for that one
case.</p>

<p>As I shall give many other life stories in their
place, I will touch only on one more phase of the
blessed influence that the new life brings to
those in prison. It enables them to face the
weary, dreary monotony of their life with happy
cheerful contentedness, despite the difficulties
and gloom that surround them.</p>

<p>There are many life-men in prison and many
more with very long terms whom one might expect
to find gloomy and morose, embittered
in heart and utterly miserable. Among them I
know innumerable cases of those who have become
cheerful, patient and humbly grateful for
every good gift of God, where we might see
only cause for complaint. Many a Christian on
the outside would have his faith strengthened by
coming into contact with these men, and their
bright experiences would make the world realize
that the essence of Christianity is its triumph
over circumstances. It can literally make the
darkness light and put the song of freedom in
the heart of the caged bird.</p>

<p>Here is a letter I received from a man whose
causes for complaint might have been considered
very justifiable. In the past he had been several
times in prison and was known to the police as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
an "ex-convict." On his last discharge he came
to us and we were witness of his manly struggles
to do right. It was before the days of our Hope
Hall, and we could not help him so much as we
longed to. He passed through a period of testing
difficulties; he not only suffered from
hunger but at times went to the point of starvation
before he was able to find work, and endured
it willingly rather than return to an evil
but easy way of making a living. He would not
accept charity, and never once asked for help except
that help which we could give him by
advice and sympathy, and hid from us the need
and suffering through which he was passing.
At last he found work and was doing well when
he was arrested and "railroaded" to prison for
an offense he did not commit.</p>

<p>I speak advisedly, for I was well acquainted
with the case and have since heard from the man
who did the deed. After his reimprisonment
with a sentence of ten years, he found Christ as
his Saviour. He wrote me constantly and the
letter quoted below reached me after he had
passed through a period of great suffering and
weakness in the prison hospital.</p>

<p>"My dear Little Mother:&mdash;I am most happy
to be able to write you a cheering letter. I
am afraid my letters the past two or three
months have been rather 'blue' reading to you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
but now, thank God, I am feeling very well and
want to chase that sorrowful expression from
your face which I suspect has been there of late
on receiving my letters. I want to write you a
cheering letter, first because I am cheerful, hopeful
and happy myself and then because I know it
will cheer and comfort you to hear that I am
fighting the battle bravely, and that the victory
we all look forward to so intensely is mine. I
have indeed experienced the new life, and God
has been my guide and refuge for two years
now and I tell you, Little Mother, I would not
exchange it for my old sinful life for the world.
My past bad name and misdeeds sent me to this
place for ten years, but I have gained by it
something I never realized or had before, the
love of our dear Saviour. I cannot help but
think of the bright happy future in store for me.
Although the state holds my body, my spirit is
free, thank God, and though clouds do gather at
times in this dreary place I have One to go
to who is all sunshine and always understands
and comforts me. Now Little Mother, I am
feeling very well. Good Dr. Ransom, God bless
him, has been like a father to me, you will never
know how much he has done for me. He asked
me the other day when I had heard from you. I
told him and he said I must never forget you.
Little Mother, I guess you know whether I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
or not. God bless you. I wish you every success
on your western trip. Pray for me," etc.</p>

<p>I give the letter just in the natural outspoken
way in which it was written. Shortly afterwards
the Doctor wrote me that his patient was undoubtedly
suffering from the first inroads of tuberculosis.
I immediately set to work on the case,
though, as a rule, I do not help men to regain
their liberty. They know that is not my mission.
Here however was one whom I believed innocent,
who had served two years and who in all likelihood
could not live out the other eight, a man
whom I believed thoroughly safe to trust at large.</p>

<p>President Roosevelt, then governor, gave me
his pardon the following New Year, and when the
"boy" received my wire with the news the joy
was too much for him, and he fainted away in the
prison hospital. We welcomed him home, put
him under excellent medical treatment and afterwards
kept him for a spring and summer on the
farm at Hope Hall. The disease was checked, he
was perfectly restored to health, and went out into
the world to work. He is still leading an upright
life not far from New York and keeps in touch
with us.</p>

<p>Could I give space to the hundreds of happy
letters that tell of the change from gloom to
brightness, from soul-bondage to freedom and
new strength, it would be clearly seen that, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the men deeply appreciate their Home and
friends and are intensely grateful for all that may
be done to help them, they fully realize the power
behind the work. It is this power that has given
them new hope and from it they have drawn their
deepest consolation and surest certainty for the
unknown future. Often in life the human friendship
is the stepping-stone to the Divine. The
moonlight makes us realize that the sun still
shines.</p>

<p>Sometime since the Chaplain of Auburn, a devoted
shepherd to that big flock wrote me as follows:
"When you were so very sick three years
ago the men here were very much alarmed and
anxious for your recovery. Among them was an
old-timer who had spent over twenty years solid
in prison out of forty-nine years of life, the longest
time of liberty between his incarcerations being
seven months. When he heard that fears were
entertained that you might not recover, he felt
impelled to pray for you. In relating the story
he said, 'I dropped on my knees to pray for her
and as I did so I was overwhelmed with the
thought that God would not hear such a sinner
as I was. I began to pray for God to have mercy
upon me and in my pleading forgot where I was
and everything but the fact that I was a sinner
and Jesus Christ my Saviour.' His sympathy for
you was the means of leading him to Christ."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
The sequel of this story made another record of
successful right-doing on the outside as well as in
prison.</p>

<p>Divine truth is not only whispered to our
hearts from the leaves of the forest, sung to us by
the mountain brook and flashed into our mind by
the glint of the sunbeam, but sometimes it looks
out at us from the wonders of science. A nerve
has been severed by accident or during an operation
and has remained for months or years perhaps
useless and atrophied. Yet operative skill
can resurrect the buried nerve ends and unite
them again restoring perfectly the lost function.
To this end especially when there has been much
loss of substance it is necessary to interpose an
aseptic absorbable body such as catgut or decalcified
bone tube to serve as a temporary scaffolding
for the products of tissue proliferation. Sutured
to this connecting substance the nerve reunites
using it as a bridge over or through which
the union can be affected. When this end is accomplished
the bridge or scaffolding is no longer
needed and disappears through absorption. This
it seems to me is the relative position of the soul-seeker
to the unsaved. The poor soul has wandered
far from God, is lost, buried beneath numberless
hindering obstacles. To a great extent
the functions of soul and conscience are destroyed,
the power to serve God, to feel aright, to be pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and good, and honest are gone; even feelings
and aspirations for things Divine in many cases
seem wanting, but we believe that all this can be
reawakened if only the soul is brought near to God.
A helpless human atom reunited to the Divine
compassionate power above. The human friend
and messenger or the organization that has the
privilege of stretching out the helping hand to
those thus needy can serve as the bridge or connection,
the link useful in the right place but
worse than useless if unaided by the loving miracle-working
power from above.</p>

<p>As I turn the pages of our little Day Book a
verse smiles out at me, the truth of which I know,
and the sweet realization of which hundreds of
happy hearts in prison to-day attest with earnest
acclamation, "Their voice was heard and their
prayer came up to His holy dwelling place even
into Heaven."</p>

<p>In such a work as that within prison walls the
results can only be fully understood by those
who have the opportunity closely to watch the
lives of the men and who can keep in touch with
them through their after experience. Results
cannot be statistically summed up and proclaimed
to the world. They are too intangible and far-reaching
to be fairly represented by figures. It
is difficult to exhibit to the public the direct
issues of this toil behind the scenes. Reporters
have often asked to accompany me to prison and
have earnestly requested permission to visit our
Hope Halls for the purpose of describing the
work. They have assured me that by allowing
this, we could arouse much public interest. We
have declined. Our movement does not live by
sensational advertisement, and even wisely written
reports would harm us with those whom we
seek to save. The men in prison are intensely
sensitive and through their bitter past experience
very apt to be suspicious of the motives of
those who go to them. Among the men who
do not know us personally there might be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
idea that the work was done with a desire for
advertising or lauding the Volunteers and to all
the men it would give the unpleasant impression
that they were still to be regarded in a different
light from the denizens of the free world. These
men naturally do not want to be exploited or
ticketed by publicity. The very spirit of our
work would be spoiled and its object defeated by
such an error, and the self-respecting men would
shun a place where their home life was not held
sacred.</p>

<p>For similar reasons we do not have our
graduates lined along the platforms of public
halls to relate the stories of their past lives, their
many crimes and subsequent conversions. This
may be thought by some to be helpful in mission
work and among church people, but in a work
like ours it would be more than unwise. Talking
of an evil past is often the first step that
leads to repeating the evil deeds. Anything
like boasting of the crimes and achievements of
an evil past cannot be too strongly deprecated.
In their own little home gatherings among themselves
our "boys" freely give their testimonies
as to what God has done for them, but even there
with no outsiders present, they feel too deeply
ashamed of the forgotten and buried past to wish
to resurrect it. One of the mottoes of Hope Hall
is, "Never talk of the past and so far as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
do not think of it." There is in this however
one disadvantage in that the world cannot have
the object lesson which would surely be helpful
to many when brought face to face with the results
already gained. The missionary can bring
back his Indian or Chinese convert and the dark
face and simple earnest broken words appeal to a
Christian audience; the doctor can exhibit his
cures at the clinic; the teacher can glory over
her scholars at their examinations, but in work
like ours the victory can never be fully shown to
the world without violating sacred confidences,
and making a show of that which it would be
cruelly unjust and unwise to parade.</p>

<p>That something of the grateful hearts and
bright hopeful lives of our graduates may be
known to others, I gather here and there, from
hundreds of like letters, just a few that will speak
for themselves.</p>

<p>To the "boys" still in prison one man writes:
"Dear Comrades:&mdash;I will try and write a few
lines to assure you, that you have in me a converted
comrade who has left the 'college' but
has not forgotten those still confined there" (as
not a few have since found out).</p>

<p>"I am very grateful for this, another opportunity
to send a few words of cheer to those
who, I know, are deprived of many blessings of
this nature that cost so little&mdash;a smile, a cheering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
word or a pleasant nod that you dare not receive
or return.</p>

<p>"Dear comrades, you probably would not
know me now, as such a marvellous change has
come over me. The dear Lord has been very
good to me. I am very often surprised at the
wonderful alterations in my life of late, the complete
abnegation of my former desires, and,
thank God! I now possess a fervent desire to
henceforth be a man.</p>

<p>"At the time of my conversion I little thought
my future life would be the success it has since
proven to be.</p>

<p>"It is just a little over two years ago since I
left 'college' and what has that two years
wrought in my life? I have made many new
friends, won their confidence and esteem, hold a
fine position on the official paper of this town,
live right with the editor in his own home, have
been elected president of one of our local Sunday-schools,
have a fine large class of little girls,
am studying preparatory to entering the University
of Illinois, have been restored to citizenship
by Governor Yates, and am now purchasing
a two thousand dollar piece of property.</p>

<p>"Dear comrades, let me give you two keys to
my success. One&mdash;God loves to bestow where
gratitude is extended; two&mdash;I have a private
book on the page of which it reads: 'May 3d,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
1902. One-tenth of my earnings, $&mdash;&mdash; paid
and used in God's cause, May....'</p>

<p>"I fear I have gone beyond the space allotted
me so must close, dear comrades, with this, my
last remark, and if you forget all the rest, remember
this: 'Value and grasp the opportunities to
form character as they are extended, and God
will take care of the rest.' Fraternally yours,
<span class="smcap">One of the Graduates</span>.</p>

<p>Another writes me after two years the following
cheering news, though as I write I can add on
another year for the record since that date.</p>

<p>"Dear Little Mother:&mdash;It is now close to two
years since I gained my liberty from Joliet Prison,
and I know that it will make you happy to know
that I am leading a good life. The thought that
you were instrumental in procuring my release
upon parole, and that you still take an interest in
me for the future gives me great joy and pride,
and I thank God for the many benefits I have received
at His hands through you.</p>

<p>"I have a splendid position at $21 per week,
and save half of it. I have the respect of my employers
and neighbors and live with my father
and mother and have the knowledge that I am
loved of God. I am happy, and have good reason
to be. I shall always appreciate your loving
kindness to me, also the help I have received
from Adjutant and Mrs. McCormick and Sergeant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Sam of Hope Hall No. 2.&mdash;Yours truly,
Frank &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The next letter is from a man who was a very
successful and notorious forger. Of him the
warden said to me one day while he was still in
prison, "If you can keep that man right after his
discharge, you will save the country thousands of
dollars. All your work would be worth while
only for one such." He was, when we first met
him a pronounced infidel and terribly embittered
against the world in general. He became a sincere
simple-hearted Christian, coming straight to
us from fifteen years in prison. He was nervous
and unstrung and felt utterly helpless to cope
with life. In this condition Hope Hall meant
everything to him. He soon regained strength,
nerve and courage. He is now a prosperous man
and has been out of prison nearly five years.</p>

<p>"Dear Little Mother:&mdash;It was my intention to
write you ere this, but my time has been so much
taken up with the cares and labor of my position,
and things are so unsettled yet, that I put it off
from one day to another, but I will not neglect
to obey the call of duty; the more so, as it entails
only a labor of love. I want you to believe
me, that my heart is in no manner changed
towards you and your work. It is just as full of
love as when first I had the happiness to meet
you in those dark and bitter days, when nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
but darkness and friendlessness seemed to be before
me, and you proved yourself such a faithful
friend. Though I still live in the shadow of the
past, there is such a lot of sunshine about me now.
If any word of mine can be a comfort to you and
a help to any one of my comrades still behind the
bars, I gladly give the word.</p>

<p>"I am well in body and mind. It seems to me
that I am making friends and well wishers everywhere.
It lies with me to stay or not, but there
are so many things in this particular business
which I cannot entirely approve, that of late I
thought much if it were not better for me to turn
to something else. I have not decided yet, but
as soon as I shall have done so, I will let you
know. Be sure of one thing, though, whatever
I shall do, or wherever I may be, there is none
anywhere, that I know of, who can replace the
friend who found me in wretchedness and
stretched forth her hand to help and comfort me.
To the Christ-love planted then in my heart, I
shall remain true in storm or sunshine."</p>

<p>Since then this man has gone into business for
himself. He is now married and has a happy
little home.</p>

<p>Another writes:</p>

<p>"Dear Little Mother:&mdash;Yours of the 4th received,
and I need not tell you how happy it
made me feel when I realized that though you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
are constantly behind the walls or touring across
the country for your 'boys' you have not forgotten
me and the other graduates. I am sure
that there are none of the 'boys' who have forgotten
you.</p>

<p>"What a blessing Hope Hall has been to the
thousands that have passed through its doors,
almost all of whom have been faithful to all that
the V.P.L. means.</p>

<p>"I have a good position and am living the life
of a God-fearing man. You would be surprised
at the number of 'boys' that I meet in the city
constantly, all looking bright and happy and
doing well in every sense of the word.</p>

<p>"Asking your prayers and praying God to bless
and prosper you in the work, Yours for Christ."</p>

<p>The remark has sometimes been made that it
is innate laziness that leads to crime. I do not
agree with this statement, but I can say that if
any of our "boys" were lazy in the old days,
they certainly have not shown it in their new
life, for we find them most anxious to work and
they often undertake and keep bravely at work
far beyond their strength.</p>

<p>"My dear Little Mother:&mdash;I was both surprised
and happy to receive your letter. I have
not only friends of the right sort, but a position
and a prospect which increases in brightness
each time I look forward after doing nine years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
in prison. When I received my pay yesterday
it was the first legitimately earned money I have
had in fifteen years. I have never regretted giving
up the past. I am satisfied with my position,
although the first few days I was not. I
wrote to Lieutenant B&mdash;&mdash;, and he advised me
to stick, in my own behalf, and his advice I have
taken. My work is hard and the hours long,
but it can never be so hard as to make me
throw up the sponge. I have a little of your
writing, which I received on last Christmas in a
Christmas present while at Hope Hall. God bless
you and your work for the 'boys' behind the
bars. Your comrade.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Enclosed find my first subscription to
the Maintenance League."</p>

<p>The next letter is from a young man who had
been the sorrow of his home people because of
his wild life. He was bright, well educated and
had good ability but he sold his soul to evil, demoralizing
pleasures. He became a thief and at
last reached the point where the patience of his
people was exhausted and they believed it impossible
for him to be reclaimed. He came to
us from a prison where our work was not yet established.
A copy of the <i>Gazette</i> had reached
him and through its influence he learned to look
upon us as his friends. He made no profession
of conversion but merely declared that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
anxious to try and make a success of an honest
life. His stay at Hope Hall was quite a long
one and we who watched him closely, could see
the growth and development of his better self as
he fought desperately the old vices.</p>

<p>Speaking to a comrade about this time he said,
"When I have written in the past to Mrs. Booth
I have never called her Little Mother because I
was not sure I was going to stay right. I dared
not call her that until I was <i>sure</i> but now when I
write it will be always, 'Little Mother.'" Here
is a letter from him after he had been twelve
months in one position, and at the same time
there came to me a letter full of commendation,
from his employer.</p>

<p>"Dear Little Mother:&mdash;I am sorry that I must
begin by asking your pardon for not having
written for so long a time, but I am deeply
thankful that my next words can be, that I have
done well in every sense of the word. After the
dull emptiness of the past, my life here comes
like the opening of summer after a long winter
of weariness and discontent. Day by day the
influences that had grown up in the old life have
been losing their place, and new interests coming
into my heart that make me happier and
stronger and better. I have written but few
letters since the beginning of the year, and I
cannot write much now, but I think you can understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
much, perhaps all, of what I feel and
would wish to say. But I can say, after the year
that has passed since I left Hope Hall, that there
are few months of my life that I can remember
with more pleasure than those I spent there, and
I have felt since leaving, that I there gained the
strength I needed to help me start life anew. I
shall always feel the influence of those months
of close companionship with the men&mdash;each
with a different story, and a different struggle,
and, no matter where my life may be passed, or
how dear the interests that may come into it, I
shall always feel, when I think of Hope Hall, the
tenderness one feels when thinking of an absent,
well-loved friend."</p>

<p>The following note was an acknowledgment
of a special copy of the little Day Book sent to
one of our "boys" shortly after his graduation.
"Dear Little Mother:&mdash;I am more pleased than
I can say for your remembrance of me and the
delightful manner of this remembrance emphasizes
itself in the gift. Every day as I read this
precious little book I will think of the giver, and
pray that God may grant unto you every good
and perfect gift. I am now in the world and
must fight my fight, but I know that that power
which alone can subdue the enemy will be my
strength and shield if I but walk circumspectly.
I know too that the testimony of words will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
avail nothing, but that it is my life that must
speak. In the selection of the evening portion
for to-day I read, 'Ye were sometimes darkness,
but now are ye light in the Lord. Walk as
children of the light.' I want my life to say this
for me. Accept, dear Little Mother, the remembrance
of a grateful heart and in the charity of
your prayers remember me."</p>

<p>To those who do not know the writers much
behind the written words cannot be realized and
I find myself saying, "After all what will these
pages mean to the public?" To me they are
unspeakably precious; they represent so many
nights of prayer and anxious days, after the darkness
of which they come as the touch of a rosy
dawn; they remind me of tears to which they
have brought the rainbow gleam of promise. I
almost grudge them to other eyes and yet if by
their words other hearts may be strengthened,
their value will be doubled.</p>

<br />
UNWELCOMED HOME-COMING</a></h2>


<p>Liberty! How much that word means to all
of us! It is the keynote of our Constitution. It
is the proud right of every citizen. The very
breeze that flutters our starry flag sings of it; the
wild forests, the rocky crags, the mountain torrents,
the waving grasses of the wide-stretching
prairies echo and reecho it. Yet much as we may
think we know of the fullness, sweetness and
power of that word, we cannot form an estimate
of its meaning to one who is in prison. He has
lost the gift and those who have it not, can often
prize the treasure more than those who possess
it.</p>

<p>People have talked to me about the prisoner
becoming quite reconciled to his lot, and in time
growing indifferent to the regaining of liberty.
I think this is one of the fallacies that the outside
world has woven. I do not know from what
prison such an idea emanated. So far as my observation
goes, I have yet to find the first prisoner
who did not long with an unspeakable
desire for freedom. Even the older life-men
who have been in long enough to outlive all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
their friends, who have no kith or kin to return
to, and for whom there is no home-spot on earth,
plead earnestly for the chance to die in liberty.
They hope and plan, they appeal and pray for
pardon, though it would send them from the familiar
sheltering walls into a strange, cold world,
but the world of free men. In every cell are
men who count all dates by one date, the day
coming to them in the future when they will be
free again. Sometimes it is very far away and
yet that does not make it any less vividly present
in their thought. The chief use in the calendar
is to mark off the passing days and some have
even figured off minutely the hours that stand
between them and liberty.</p>

<p>There is a weird cry that breaks out sometimes
amid the midnight stillness of the prison cell-house,
the venting of a heart's repressed longing,
"Roll around, 1912," and from other cells other
voices echo, each putting in the year of his liberty.
I heard the cry break out in chapel one
Christmas day as the gathering at their concert
broke up, every year being called by the "boys"
who looked forward to it as their special year of
liberty. "Roll around, 1912." How far away it
seems to us even in liberty, but how much further
to the man who must view it through a vista of
weary toilsome prison days.</p>

<p>Having talked with many just before their dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
when the days and hours leave but a few
grains to trickle through the glass of time they
have watched so closely, I know just what a
strain and tension these last days represent.
Often the man cannot sleep for nights together
under the excitement and the nervous strain
proves intense. Through the dark nights of
wakefulness he puts the finishing touches to the
castles in the air that he has been building
through the weary term when with his body in
prison, his mind wandered out into the days to
come, and hope, battling with fear, painted for
him a rainbow in the storm clouds of the future.</p>

<p>Can you imagine how hard and bitter is the
awakening for such a man when he returns to
life to find himself a marked and branded being,
one to be distrusted and watched, pointed out
and whispered about, with all too often the door
of honest toil shut in his face? The man discharged
from prison is not unreasonable. He
does not expect an easy path. We do not ask
for him a way strewn with roses or a cheer of
welcome. He has sinned, he has strayed from
the right road, plunged over the precipice of
wrong-doing, and it must at best be a hard climb
back again. The men do not ask nor do we ask
for them an easy position, the immediate restoration
of the trust, confidence and sympathy of
the world on the day of their return. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
know they cannot expect, having thrown away
their chances in an evil past, to find them awaiting
their return to moral sanity. I have not
found them unreasonable and certainly very few
have been lazy or unwilling to prove their sincerity.
What we do ask for the released prisoner
and what we feel he has a right to ask of the
world is a chance to live honestly, an opportunity
to prove whether or not he has learned
his lesson so that he may climb back into the
world of freedom and into a useful respectable
position where he may be trusted.</p>

<p>When God forgives us He says that our sins
and transgressions shall be blotted out like a
cloud or cast into the sea of His forgetfulness.
He believes in a buried past. The world alas!
too often goes back to that wretched old grave
to dig up what lies there, and flaunts the miserable
skeleton before the eyes of the poor soul,
who had fondly hoped that when the law was
satisfied to the last day and hour, he had paid
for his crime, and might begin afresh with a clean
sheet to write a new record.</p>

<p>How often we hear the term "ex-convict."
Do the people who use it ever stop to think that
the wound is as deep and the term as odious as
that of "convict" to the man who has been in
prison? When he is liberated, when the law has
said, "Go in peace and sin no more," he is a free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
man, and no one has the right to regard him as
other than this. Any name which marks him
out is a cruel injustice. If the State provided for
the future of these men; if they were not dependent
on their own labors for their daily bread,
it would not be quite so ghastly, but when one
thinks that this prejudice and marking of discharged
prisoners, robs them of the chance of
gaining a living, and in many instances forces
them back against their will into a dishonest
career, one can realize how truly tragic the situation
is.</p>

<p>Many a time one can pick up a daily paper
and see the headlines, "So and So to be Liberated
To-morrow," or, "Convict ... will return to
the world," or some such announcement. If a
man who is at all notorious has finished a term
in prison, the article tells of the crime he committed
five, six or even ten years before; what
he did; how he did it; why he did it. Some
account of his imprisonment&mdash;with an imaginary
picture of himself in his cell&mdash;may be added,
with the stripes in evidence, and even a chain and
ball to make it more realistic. This heralds the
day of his discharge. What a welcome back
after his weary paying of the penalty through
shame and loneliness, toil and disgrace, mingled
often with bitter tears of repentance during those
best years lost from his life forever! This raking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
up of the past reminds his friends and acquaintances
of the wretched story which had been
nearly forgotten, and tells it to many more who
had not heard of it. Is this fair? Perhaps it
may be said that this is part of the penalty of doing
wrong. I answer that it should not be! In a civilized
land our wrong-doers must be punished by
proper lawful means. The law does not require
this publicity after release. Why should the
world ask it? Besides that, could we not quote
the recommendation given of old that only those
who are without sin have the right to cast stones,
and, if that precept were lived up to, very few
would ever be cast at all, for the saint in heart
and life would be charitable.</p>

<p>It does not take many days of tramping in a
fruitless search for work, or many rebuffs and
slights, to shake for the most sanguine man the
foundation of those castles he saw in the air
before his term expired. When money is gone,
and there is no roof to cover the weary head, no
food to stop the gnawing of hunger, and no friend
at hand to sympathize, the whole airy structure
topples to the ground amid the dust and ashes of
his fond hopes, and the poor man learns in bitterness
of heart an anger against society that makes
him more dangerous and desperate than he ever
was before.</p>

<p>Much is said of the habitual criminal. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
contend that he is born, that, as a poor helpless
infant, he is doomed to a career of crime and
vice. Others believe that such lives are the outcome
of malformation of brain and skull, and yet
others have their own pet theories to account for
the large number of "repeaters," as they are
called in some states, "old-timers," or "habituals,"
as they are known elsewhere. I have
personally known many of these men and have
traced their lives, talked with them heart to heart,
and I can tell the world, as my profound conviction,
that the habitual criminal is made, not
born; manufactured by man, not doomed by a
monster-god; that such criminals are the result
of the lack of charity, of knowledge or thought
or whatever else you may like to call it, that
makes the world shrink from and doom the sinner
to a return to sin, that treads further down
in the mire the man who has fallen.</p>

<p>What is a man to do on leaving prison with
his friends dead or false to him, with no home,
little money, the brand of imprisonment upon
him, nervous, unstrung, handicapped with the
loss of confidence in himself, and with neither
references nor character? The cry of the world
is, "Let the man go to work; if he is honest, and
proves himself so, then we will trust him and
stretch out a hand to help him." Ah, then if
that day ever comes to him, he will not need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
your outstretched hand. Your chance to help
and strengthen him will have passed forever; the
credit of his success will be all his own, but few
can reach that happy day. It is easy to say, let
the man work, but where shall he find occupation;
who wants the man who can give no
clear account of himself? If in honesty of heart
he tells the truth and states, "I am straight from
prison," he is told to go on his way, and often
the voice that gives the command is harsh with
indignant contempt and loathing, and yet this
man has one inalienable right in common with
all his fellow-men, the right to live, and to live,
the man must have bread. Some have said to
me that it is cruel that the right to end their
lives is denied them, for should they commit
suicide they would only be condemned, and if
they attempted it and were not successful, they
would be imprisoned for trying to do away
with that which no man helped them to make
endurable.</p>

<p>These released men are not of the beggar
class. Their hands are eager for work. Their
brains have a capacity for useful service, yet they
have to stand idle and starve, or turn to the old
activities and steal. Does the world say this is
exaggerated? I declare I have again and again
had proof of it. I believe that with hundreds
who are now habitual criminals, and have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
themselves experts in their nefarious business,
there was a day when they truly wanted to be
honest and tried to follow up that desire, but
found the chance denied them.</p>

<p>Of course the man who has a home, who has
friends standing by him or who is a very skilled
workman can escape this trial in a great measure,
but I speak of the many who are friendless, and
hence must face the world alone. It has been
said by those who would excuse their apathy and
lack of interest in the question, that, while there
are honest workmen unemployed, they do not
see why people should concern themselves about
the returning criminal. This is very poor logic.
You might as well argue that it is sentimental to
feed with care our sick in the hospitals, because
there are able bodied folk starving in the streets
of our cities. The Spartans took their old and
sick and weak to the caves of the mountains and
left them there to meet death. Perhaps that was
the most convenient way of getting out of their
problems and shirking a care that meant trouble
and expense. But we are not in long-ago pagan
Sparta but in twentieth century Christian America.
Quite apart from his claim on our sympathy
as followers of Christ, in the purely selfish
light of the interest of the community, it is
dangerous to deprive men of the chance of making
an honest living. Naturally they will then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
prey on others and the problem will become
more and more complicated as they go farther
from rectitude and honesty.</p>

<p>I know some writers of fiction have played on
this theme of the poor worthy workman and the
unworthy "ex-prisoner" with telling effect.
They have made those who tried to help the latter
appear in the light of foolish sentimentalists
while the workman is depicted as starving for want
of the friendship they refuse him. This however
is but a stage trick of literary coloring. The honest
workman has his union behind him; he is often
out of work through its orders; if he does not
belong to the union, he at least has a character
and, in this age of philanthropy, charity and
many missions, he can apply for aid which will
be speedily given, if he proves that he is deserving.
He may be unfortunate but he has not behind
him the record, around him the almost insurmountable
difficulties of the man from prison.
We ought to help the latter because in most
instances he cannot help himself. Alas, there
are very few ready to render practical help,
writers of fiction to the contrary.</p>

<p>I do not advocate carrying him and thus making
him dependent upon others. I do not believe
in pauperizing any one. Give him a fair start
and then let him take his own chance with any
other workman and by his own actions stand or fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>I was visiting my Hope Hall on one occasion
after a lengthy western trip. Many new men
who had returned during my absence were anxious
for personal interviews and so I spent most
of the day in this occupation. One man who was
ushered into my presence was considerably older
than any other of the newcomers. Grasping
my hand he told me with tears in his eyes of his
gratitude for the Home. I asked him if he was
happy. "Happy," he answered, "why I am
happier than I have ever been in my life." As
we talked I studied his face. I could recognize
no criminal trait and I wondered at one of his
age with hair already white, being friendless and
homeless and at the place where he must begin
life all over again. I came to the conclusion
that he had probably served a very long term
for some one offense committed in his early
manhood. It is not my custom to bring up the
past. We do not catechise our men concerning
their deeds of the past. If it will help a man to
tell me in confidence any part of his story, I
gladly listen, but I never make one feel that I
am eager to learn the wretched details that in
many instances are better buried and forgotten.
In this case, however, I diverged from my rule
sufficiently to ask this man whether he had done
a very long term, that I might answer to myself
some of those questions that would better help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
me to prove myself his friend in the future.
"No," he answered with a smile, "I have that
to be thankful for; I have never been sentenced
to any very long term. I have only done five
short five year bits." Just think of it! Twenty-five
years in all! The record of an habitual
criminal indeed. Speaking afterwards to one of
my workers, who knew the man well, I asked
him how it was that this had happened. He told
me that it was just the old story, that could be recorded
about many others. In his youth this
man had committed a crime which called for a
five year term of imprisonment. He had been
overwhelmed with shame and regret, and during
that first term in prison had learned his lesson.
During that period his father and mother both
died; he came back into the world homeless,
friendless, a stranger. In his pocket he had a
few dollars given by the State and he started out
hopefully to look for work. He was met by rebuff,
disappointment and failure; then came
hungry days and nights, when he had no money
to pay for lodging, and had to sleep in any
sheltered corner where he might hope to escape
the vigilance of the police. Then followed starvation,
and he returned to what seemed the inevitable;
he stole that he might live; was arrested
and sent back to prison. This was repeated after
each discharge, until at last he had Hope Hall to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
turn to, a haven of refuge from the miserable sin
and failure of his life.</p>

<p>A story even more startling was told me by a
chaplain of one of our State Prisons. The man
of whom he spoke was brought up in the most
wretched environment; his parents were drunkards,
his home did not deserve the name. As a
mere child he was cast out on the streets to earn
his own living by begging or theft. If he did
not bring back enough at night to suit his parents,
he was beaten and thrown out on the streets
to sleep. He became early an expert young
thief; from picking pockets he advanced to a
more dangerous branch of the profession and
became a burglar. When about eighteen years
of age he was arrested and given a long term in
prison. During that term he was for the first
time taught the difference between right and
wrong; he learned to read and write in the night
school and thus was opened up a new world before
him. He heard the teachings of the chaplain
from the chapel platform and for the first
time, he understood that it was possible even for
him to live a different kind of life from that which
had seemed to be his destiny. On his discharge
from prison, he was a very different man from
what he had been on his admission. He went
out with the firm resolve to do right. He
laughed at difficulties, saying cheerily that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
was going to work and feeling in his heart that
with his earnest desire to do so faithfully, he
must make a success of the future. After a few
days of effort in the big city, he found that it was
not so easy to obtain employment as he had anticipated.
Day after day he sought it earnestly,
always meeting with the same disappointment.
Leaving the city, he tramped out to the surrounding
towns and villages; for several weeks
this man sought for an honest start in life, but no
hand was stretched out to help him. His money
was long since spent; he had to sleep at night
under some hedge or in some secluded alley way.
The food on which he subsisted was the broken
pieces and partly decayed fruit picked from
the ash barrels of the more fortunate. At last
flesh and blood could stand the strain no longer,
and he returned to Boston, his strength gone,
his mind benumbed and a fever raging in his
blood. Crossing the Common on a bleak rainy
afternoon, he stumbled and lost consciousness.
Hours passed and in the shadow he was unnoticed.
The poor, lost, unwanted outcast lay
there, with the great happy busy world rushing
on within a few feet of him. A man who was
crossing the Common chanced to stumble over
the prostrate figure. He stooped to see what lay
in his path and finding that it was a man, he
turned him so that the lamplight fell upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
face and then with an exclamation called him by
name.</p>

<p>Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.
This poor, dying, friendless man had been found
by perhaps the one man who knew him best in
that great city. Thinking that he was sleeping
or perhaps drunk, the man shook him, saying,
"Who's going to build a monument for you that
you lie out here on the Common catching your
death of cold?" Finding no answer, he repeated
his question, adding, "Trying to be honest, are
you? Who cares enough to build your monument,
I want to know." Then he realized that
the man was past speech, and lifting him from
the ground, he tenderly guided the staggering
foot-steps to his own home. True, his home
consisted of rooms above a saloon; true, this
Samaritan was himself the leader of a gang of
burglars, and yet the deed was one of charity,
and his was the one hand stretched out to help
this sick and helpless man. For weeks he was
carefully nursed and tended. The doctor was
called to watch over him. When the fever left
him and strength returned, nourishing food was
provided, and when he was well enough to dress
he was welcomed in the room where the gang
met and not in any sense made to feel that he
had been a burden. All this time no effort had
been made to draw him back into the old way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
living. One night as he sat at a little distance he
heard his friends plan a burglary. They had a
map stretched out upon the table before them
and had marked upon it the several positions to
be occupied by different members of the gang,
some to enter, while others watched and guarded
the house. One point was unguarded and while
they were seeking to readjust their company to
fill this place, the young man rose and coming to
the table, he laid his finger on the spot and said,
"Put me down there." The leader of the gang,
who had proved so truly his friend, laid his hand
upon his shoulder and said quickly, "Don't you
do it! You have been trying to be honest, stick
to it! You have had a long term in prison and
are sick of it. Don't go back to the old life."
But the boy turning on him (and there was much
truth in his answer) said, "When I was sick and
hungry, who cared? When I was trying to be
honest, who helped me? When I lay dying on
the common, who was it stretched out a helping
hand, who paid my doctor's bill and who nursed
me? You did and with you I shall cast in my
lot." He would not be dissuaded. That night he
not only went out and aided in the burglary but
was caught by the police. In his trial the fact
came out that he had only been a few months
out of prison. The fact that he had been so
soon detected in crime with his old gang was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
evidence of his criminal propensities and he was
returned to prison for an extra long term as an
old offender.</p>

<p>There is, however, a court above where
all cases will be tried again and there the
Judge will take loving cognizance of the hard
struggle, the awful loneliness and suffering, the
earnest desire to do right that went before this
fall, and His judgment will be tempered with divine
mercy.</p>

<p>The watching and hounding of men to prison
by unprincipled detectives is not unknown in
this country. In fact, you can find such cases
often quoted in the newspapers and every prison
has its quota of men who could tell you terrible
stories of what they have endured. I do not
want to appear hostile to the Detective Department,
for detectives are necessary and many may
be conscientious men. The criminal element
know and respect the conscientious detective,
but they have a most profound contempt for the
man who vilely abuses his authority and seems to
have no conscience where one known as an "ex-prisoner"
is concerned. Revelations have been
made in many of our big cities of the blackmail
levied upon criminals and the threats which have
been used to extort money. There is no need
of my quoting cases to prove this point, as it has
been clearly proved over and over again in police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
investigations which are fresh in the memory
of the public.</p>

<p>The man from prison is a marked man and
hence an easy prey to the unscrupulous detective.
Jean Val Jean, the hero of Victor Hugo's
"Les Miserables" is perhaps looked upon as a
fictitious creation of the great novelist's brain,
but he is a reality! There are Jean Val Jeans
in the prisons of this land and many a man
struggling to remake his life, longing to forget
the disgraceful past, has been dogged and haunted
by his crime, to be taken back at last to the horror
of a living death which, he had hoped, would
never claim him again.</p>

<p>The impression and opinion that there is no
good in one who has been in prison not only
robs him of sympathy on the part of the good
and honest and makes him an easy prey to the
unscrupulous, but lessens the compunction of
society for the wrong it does him. "Oh, well,"
cry the righteous in justification of their actions,
"he would probably have done the first job that
offered, so it makes no odds. Criminals are
safer in prison anyway." So justice is drugged
with excuses and the helpless one she should
have protected is handed over to rank injustice,
with the excuse that he deserves his fate.
Has not the sword of justice once been raised
over him, setting him aloof from his fellows?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Some years ago a young man who had fully
learned his lesson in prison was discharged from
Sing Sing, with the earnest desire to retrieve the
past. At first it was difficult to find a position,
but at last he obtained employment with a large
firm where he served some months, giving every
satisfaction to his employers. As time wore on,
he felt that the sad shadow of the past was gone
forever. One day as he walked up Broadway
carrying under his arm a parcel which he was to
deliver to a customer, he felt a hand suddenly
fall on his shoulder. The cheery tune he had
been whistling abruptly ceased. It seemed as if
a cloud passed over the sunshine obscuring it as
he turned to recognize in the man who accosted
him, the detective who had once sent him to
state prison. "What are you doing?" asked
the detective. "I am working for such and such
a firm," he said. "What have you got under
your arm?" was the next question. "Some
clothes I am taking to a customer." "We'll
soon find out the truth of this," said the detective
and despite the entreaties of the man, he
marched him back to the store, walked with him
past his fellow-employees and accosted the manager.
"Is this man in your employ?" he asked.
The question was answered in the affirmative.
"Did you send him with these clothes to a customer?"
Again the satisfactory answer. "Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
well," said the detective, "it is all right but I
thought I had better inquire and let you know
that this man is an ex-convict." Then he went
on his way, but his work had been well done.
The young man was disgraced before all his
fellow-clerks and was promptly dismissed, not
for dishonesty, not for laziness, not because he
had proved unworthy of trust, but simply and
solely because he had once been in prison.
Once more he was made to suffer for the crime
which the law said he had fully expiated.</p>

<p>The following instance I give from one of our
daily papers, only the other day.</p>

<p>"How far a policeman may go in an effort to
arrest persons charged with no specific crime,
but who have their pictures in the Rogues' Gallery,
may be determined by Commissioner Greene
as a result of a shooting in Twenty-third Street
yesterday, when that thoroughfare was crowded.</p>

<p>"A detective sergeant, while in a car, saw
seated near the rear door two men whom he
recognized, he says, as pickpockets. The men's
pictures and descriptions being, as alleged, in
Inspector McClusky's private album. The detective
therefore determined to take them to
headquarters.</p>

<p>"When near Lexington Avenue the two men
left the car, being closely followed by their pursuer.
The detective sergeant called upon them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
to halt, which they refused to do, and he fired.
One of the men says the detective sergeant fired
at him, but the detective insists that he fired in
the air. Women screamed and men took refuge
in entrances to buildings. Two policemen then
arrested the men, who gave their names as John
Kelley and Daniel Cherry. Commissioner
Greene has ordered an investigation."</p>

<p>I need add no comment. The story is merely
an illustration of the old adage, "Give a dog a
bad name, and you might as well hang him." I
do not want my remarks to be one-sided. The
detective officer is needed. Some of the officers
are very able, bright men and I have known some
who have been fair-minded and good at heart but
that great abuses of power have been practiced
and many men made victims to the old idea that
the once marked man has no rights, no honor,
and can come to no possible good, is an incontestable
fact. Public opinion, steered by Christian
charity regarding the rights of those who
cannot protect themselves, is the safe-guard to
which we must appeal.</p>

<p>Perhaps the bitterest experience is that of the
man who succeeds in getting a start, who strives
hard and in time makes for himself a position by
faithful, honest work and who after it all, has the
building of years torn down, and his life blasted
by the unjustifiable raking up of the past. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
story startling the state of Ohio was flashed all
over the country not long since, which very
pointedly illustrated this fact. A man in his
youth had committed an offense which had sent
him to prison for five years; I believe it was the
striking of a blow in a moment of anger; he
served his term and it proved the lesson of his
life. Coming out of prison, he moved into the
state of Ohio and found work in Columbus. It
was humble work at the very bottom of the
ladder, but, as years passed, his industry was
rewarded by great success and at last he became
a very prominent and wealthy business man.
He had had to confide his past to one or two
people in the city, so that when he commenced
to work, he would not be doing so under false
colors. As time went on and wealth, social
position and important business connections
became his, these people in a most unprincipled
manner commenced the levying of blackmail.
For many years his life was made miserable, and
he was thus robbed of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>There was nothing dishonorable in his life; he
was a perfectly straight, successful business man,
but he knew well that the prejudice against the
man that has been in prison is so great that his
successful career would be ruined and he himself
ostracized, if these blackmailers published the
fact which they threatened to reveal, that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
once been in prison. At last when he could
stand this wretched position no longer, he made
a statement to the papers, through his lawyer,
publishing to the world the fact of his early
imprisonment, that he might thus break the
weapons of his enemies. If the world's attitude
to the returned prisoner were more rational and
its judgment were passed on his after life and
conduct instead of the mere fact of the past
penalty, such a state of things would be impossible.</p>

<p>Many will have read of the case that came up
in the New York papers, of the fireman who had
served faithfully for fifteen years in the fire
department, receiving honorable mention for his
bravery. In his youth he had been in a prison,
had served part of his term, from which he had
been pardoned by the then governor of our
state; during the investigation in the fire department
this man was called to the stand, and
immediately his past was probed into by the
opposing lawyer. He pleaded with tears in his
eyes, that the fifteen years of faithful service
should have lived down that one offense of his
youth, but mercy was not shown him and the
head lines of the papers on the following day
announced in the most glaring type the "Ex-convict's"
testimony. Faithfulness, honesty,
courage were all as nothing compared to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
stain which years of suffering and hard labor in
prison ought to have obliterated.</p>

<p>I had watched with interest the career of one
of our "boys" who had been a most notorious
prisoner, living a desperate life and having long
experience in crime, which had brought him to
the position where many spoke of him as beyond
hope. He had been out of prison over a year
and was doing well; he had been graduated from
our Home and held a position to which we sent
him, most creditably, and was now living with
his wife in a little flat in Harlem, working in a
shop where his service was giving thorough
satisfaction. Some flats were entered and property
stolen in the upper part of the city. There
was no trace of the perpetrator of the crime. A
detective who had known this man in the past,
learning that he was in the city, started out to
hunt for him. He discovered the fact that he
lived in Harlem: without a scrap of evidence
against him, he went to the house and put him
under arrest, and the first I knew of the case was
a flaring account in the papers headed, "Mrs.
Booth's Protégé Gone Wrong." We received
almost immediately a letter from him from the
Tombs, and one of my representatives went at
once to see our "boy." The second newspaper
article gave an interview with the detective, in
which he mentioned the fact that he had been at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
my office and that I had told him that I had long
since suspected this young man of wrong-doing;
that I had no faith or confidence in him, and could
no longer help him. At the time the interview
was supposed to have taken place, I was fifteen
hundred miles away. When the case was brought
up for investigation, my representative was present
to stand by the man, and to tell the judge
what we knew concerning him. There not being
a particle of evidence to connect him with the
crime, the judge, with some irritation, was about
to dismiss the case, when the detective stepped
forward, and asked that the man be held to enable
him to make further investigation. "What are
you going to investigate?" asked the judge,
"you have no evidence to go on." "Oh," said
the detective, "I want to look up his past; he
has been many times in prison." Then, I am
glad to say, the judge meted out justice, and
turning to the detective, reproved him most
severely. He told him that he was there to judge
present facts and evidence, not to condemn a man
because of his past, and that it did not matter
what the man had been, if there was no evidence
that he had perpetrated crime, no one had any
right to hold him or to investigate records that
did not concern the case. The man on his discharge
went back to his former employment, but
it had been a severe and bitter trial, for naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
he felt in his own heart the injustice of the whole
incident. He has, however, courageously fought
through his dark days and now for years has been
a successful and prosperous man.</p>

<p>Of course there are men who come out of prison
planning to do evil. They are those who have not
learned their lesson, and to whom imprisonment
has proved merely a deterring influence instead
of a reforming one. Some men deliberately go
to the first saloon to celebrate their discharge
and some may be found in the old haunts the
first night of freedom. But even with these
cases, which are apparently utterly hardened
and careless, there may have been a time before
they drifted so far, when they also longed for the
friendly hand, which might have helped them
back from the deep waters to the safe ground of
honest living. Careless and hardened as they
may seem to-day, we have no right to think
that there may not be an awakening to better
possibilities to-morrow; so while there is life,
we should see to it that so far as our part of the
question is concerned, there is the possibility of
hope also.</p>

<p>How often and how fervently are those simple
words sung out by earnest loyal hearts from end to
end of the English-speaking world. The refrain
has burst forth at Christmas gatherings, at home-comings
from school, on every festive occasion,
around all true home hearths, and its echo has
been heard on plain and prairie, amid mountain
peaks and forest fastness, as wanderers have in
thought turned homeward. There is perhaps no
place where the old tune and well loved words
sound with more pathos, than when the refrain
is raised in a prison audience and rolled through
the chapel or around the gallery by a thousand
manly voices. Heads are bowed, eyes grow
dim with tears and sometimes lips tremble too
much to frame the words. I have heard it thus
and have tried to read the faces of the men as
the song called up to them the past. Some
have sung with a longing and yearning in which
still lingered the note of glad possession, while
for them arose a picture of a dear home-spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
where they were still held in loving remembrance
and to which in the future they would again be
welcomed. Others under still deeper emotion
have seen a vision of the home that was, the
memory of childhood's happy hours gone forever
with the passing of the mother-heart into
the far-away grave. Fathers sometimes drop
their heads upon the seats before them and
strong men though they are, give way to bitter
tears as they picture the little white-robed tots
who kneel up in their beds to pray that papa
may some day come home, and ask the mother
over again in childish perplexity why he stays
away so long, and then drop to sleep wondering
at her tears. But some of those in the great
audience know no home as a future bright spot,
for they have never known the sacred influence
which should be every man's birthright. Even
in their hearts there is a longing to possess that
which they have missed, and the song awakens
a strange, untranslatable thrill that makes them
feel lonely and forsaken without knowing why.</p>

<p>Quite early in the history of our work the
need of practical help for men on their discharge
from prison became very evident. They had
given us their confidence and accepted our proffered
friendship, had made resolves to live honest
lives in the future and would go forth to be met
by the difficulties and sometimes almost insurmountable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
obstacles awaiting them in an unfriendly
world. Was it not natural to foresee that
they would turn in their difficulty to those who
had been their friends in prison? What then
were we to do? Give them advice, bid them
trust in God? All very well in the right
place, but, to the penniless, homeless man, cold
charity. We realized that to make our work
thoroughly practical, we must be as ready and
able to help the man on his discharge, as to
counsel him during his incarceration. To do
this successfully, we soon understood that for the
homeless and friendless man we must provide a
home. Some who have concerned themselves
with a scientific discussion of plans to help discharged
prisoners have argued against the wisdom
of such a step. They speak of the danger
of congregating men and would, I suppose, advocate
the finding work for the man on the day
of his discharge from prison. It is always easy
to theorize, discuss and argue when you are not
in the midst of an urgent need and obliged at
once to face the subject and to decide by the
circumstances instead of by your own worked-out
conclusions. Practical experience is that
which proves and alone can prove the wisdom or
folly of any step. We have found in our work
that it is not possible or practicable to find work
for these men on the day of their discharge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Many a one coming from State Prison is absolutely
unfit to take his place in the busy working
world so soon after his prison experience. On
the other hand, is it wise to ask business men to
take men whom we have not tested and of whom we
know nothing? Some men, indeed many are in
downright earnest, but a few may not be, and if one
recommends a man without knowing his capacity,
suitability or sincerity, one is asking of the employer
that which few would care to undertake.
If men thus placed at work directly after their
discharge fail through inability or lack of nerve
and strength, they become utterly discouraged
and it is a sore temptation to turn aside to an
easier way of gaining a livelihood. If on the
other hand, they go wrong, the employer is prejudiced,
and the door is shut against others who
might have made good use of the chance. I believe
this is one of the causes that has brought
prison work into disrepute and has made business
men adverse to lending a helping hand to
men from prison.</p>

<p>That the gathering of men together for a time
in a well conducted happy home is not in any
way detrimental, but exceedingly helpful, we have
had ample time to prove. If there is no home
for these who are homeless, where are they to
go? Respectable boarding houses and hotels
would not willingly receive them and would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
beyond their means. They would have to go
down to the common lodging houses where they
would immediately be liable to meet old companions
and be faced again with the temptation
of spending their evenings on the street or in the
saloon. The rapid improvement physically,
mentally and spiritually of those who have come
to Hope Hall has spoken more loudly than any
arguments or theories could have done. That
many men come out of prison in a terribly nervous,
unmanned condition is incontestable. Far
be it from me, knowing of the improvements
made during the last few years in prison management,
to cast any reflection on the care of
our prisoners, still, the fact is here and must be
faced. If we were dealing with horses and cattle,
proper care in feeding, exercising, and in the
planning of hygienic surroundings would suffice
to keep the subjects well and would insure their
good condition, for there one has only the body
to deal with. In the case of human beings, we
must reckon with the heart, brain and sensitive
nervous system. Well fed, well clothed, well
housed and yet with the mind and heart crushed
and sore and anxious, at times almost insane
with despair, a man may become a wreck however
well treated, and as years pass, he will lose
the nerve and force he so much needs for the
efforts of the future. Even the most phlegmatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
of dispositions, coming out into a world after
years of the strictly ordered routine prison life,
feels strangely cut adrift and utterly bewildered
in the rush of the world that has forged ahead in
its racing progress while he has been so long
side-tracked. Fresh air, a good sleeping place,
friendly faces and cheering Christian influence
with elevating surroundings mean everything to
a man in these early, anxious days.</p>

<p>Thank God some have homes to go to, where a
loving mother or a tender wife stands between
them and the gazing, critical world. There they
can regain self-control and can have a breathing
space, before they face the struggle which is
almost sure to await them. But what of those
who have no home, no friends, no place to turn?
Especially does this need confront us in the case
of the long time prisoner. Think of coming
back into life after fifteen or twenty years' imprisonment!
After six weeks in a hospital
room, the streets seem to us a roaring torrent of
danger. One feels as if every car were bent on
running one down and the very pedestrians are
possessed to one's imagination with a desire to
collide with one at every step. The weakened
nerves are alarmed at the unusual stir and noise;
one's eyes are dazzled at the glare of light and
one's feet seem to move, not with one's own
volition, but with some notion of their own as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
where they should stagger and it is a relief to
creep away into some quiet corner. Now picture
the return of one who has been banished
behind high gates and kept in the close limits
of cell and prison workshop for twenty or thirty
years. The "L" road, cable cars, electric trolleys,
sky scrapers and countless other wonders of the
age are absolutely new to him, and in the
crowded streets, the throngs of human beings
pressing hither and thither are all strangers to
this man from the inside world. Added to this
is the knowledge of his own condition, and he is
an easy prey to an abnormally developed fancy.
He imagines that every man who meets him can
tell whence he has come. His very nervousness
and lack of confidence make him act suspiciously.</p>

<p>Then there are the sick. The fact that a man
has been more or less ailing for months is not a
cause for detention in prison. When his term
expires, the authorities have no power to keep
him and naturally such a man would bitterly
resent the lengthening of his term; and yet he
may be far too ill to undertake work and in just
the condition when kindness and care would
mean everything to both present and future.</p>

<p>Surely it is needless to picture more causes
for the step that we felt led to take as the second
phase of our work. The "boys" needed a home
and the need called for speedy action. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
home was planned and opened six months after
the work in prison had started, and hundreds
to-day look back to it as a blessed haven of
rest; a bright spot which has been to many the
first and only one in life. When we first started,
the plans were all talked over in prison. I took
the men, not the public, into my confidence.
The idea was warmly welcomed and every item
of news about the project looked for with keenest
interest. Our idea was to have a place that
would be a real home and not an institution.
We did not want a mission in the city with
sleeping rooms attached; certainly not a place
placarded "Prisoners' Home," "Shelter for Ex-convicts,"
etc. Our friends were no longer prisoners,
our guests were never to be called
ex-convicts. It was to be a home hidden
away from the public, and as much as possible
patterned after that to which the mother
would welcome her boy were she living and
able to do so. In Sing Sing Prison we named
our Home, and the name chosen was "Hope
Hall." We felt that that name would have no
brand in it and we earnestly prayed that it might
prove the threshold of hope to those who passed
through its doors to the new life of the future.
In the matter of furnishing, the same idea of
homelikeness and comfort without extravagance
was carried out. Pretty coloring and light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
cheeriness have always been aimed at as affording
the best contrast to the gloom and dreariness
of the narrow prison cell.</p>

<p>The house we first opened was a large frame
building on Washington Heights, that had
once been a Club. After two years we moved
into the country on Long Island, that we might
have a home of our own and more ground to
cultivate. We purchased a ten acre farm and
by degrees have enlarged and improved the
house, reclaimed and cultivated the ground and
made a home which proves a veritable surprise
to the many who have looked forward to
it for years, and yet even in their dreams have
not painted it as brightly as it deserved. If you
give, give freely, that the receiver may feel that
you have done your best and then you will
appeal to his true heart gratitude. If your
giving is with many limitations the receiver will
say, "Oh, I see they think anything is good
enough for me," and your intended blessing may
lose all its value. We have realized this fact and
borne it in mind in all our work. As our superintendent
showed a newcomer around the Home
on one occasion, the man turned to him and
with eyes filled with tears exclaimed, "Oh! I
ought to be good after this." The same thought
has been seen in many lives and we have wanted
our Home to so truly fulfill its purpose that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
might form a veritable barrier between the men
and their past.</p>

<p>Of course the undertaking was not an easy
one. We had no capital behind us, the Volunteer
movement was then but a young organization
and our work in the prisons was at a stage
where people looked at it as a doubtful experiment.
Money was gathered slowly and very
uncertainly. Some months, through our meetings
we received very cheering returns; during
others, especially in the heat of summer we had
to face grave anxiety and often did not know
where the next dollar was coming from. On one
such dark day, when bills were due and the funds
exhausted, at a meeting of my League in prison,
I told the "boys" of the burden I was bearing.
Already we had so truly become sharers together
of this work that it seemed natural to lighten my
heart by talking freely to the "boys" and asking
them to pray with me for the financial help we
so needed. Some weeks after this as I opened
the pile of mail that lay on my desk, I came to
an envelope marked as coming from the warden's
office. Laying other letters aside I hastened
to open it, thinking it might be the news
of some home-coming or other urgent business
connected with one of our many friends. There
were only a few words on the sheet of paper, but
the enclosure proved to be a check for four hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
and forty-seven dollars. This was the result
of a collection taken up by the men among
themselves, in token of their appreciation of and
confidence in our work. This money represented
a sacrifice the outside world can hardly
compute, for it was spared from the small sums
they had on deposit, which could furnish them
with little comforts or necessities during the long
years of prison life. To say how much comfort
and strength my heart received from this thought
and love so practically expressed, would be impossible
through the poor medium of type and
paper, but together with many subsequent signs,
it made it possible for me to realize how truly
the "boys" were with us. To have them in full
accord with the work means more to me than
would the plaudits of the public or the patronage
of the wealthy.</p>

<p>As years have passed, many dear friends have
been raised up to help us and they have done
nobly. A large number have joined our Maintenance
League, paying a given sum monthly or
yearly, and some very helpful and generous donations
have been received. Still the raising of
the funds is our one dark cloud and appears our
hardest problem. For five years past, this has
forced me to spend much of my time on the lecture
platform, earning money to meet the growing
needs of the work. Fortunately through inheritance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
I am personally independent, so that
my husband and I take no salary for our services,
but even giving as I do all my earnings to the
work, the fact remains that time thus spent is
taken from my direct purpose and is a great expenditure
of effort and strength sorely needed
elsewhere.</p>

<p>When the Home was first started we laid down
a few simple rules to guard and govern it. It
should be borne in mind that it is not a home for
criminals, it is a home for men who earnestly desire
to do right. They come there because they
have done with the old life, and our first condition
is that those who come to Hope Hall must
come direct from State Prison. This is to guard
our family of earnest men from those who might
come to Hope Hall as a last resort after spending
their money in the old haunts. We drew no
narrow lines of eligibility. The Catholic was to
be as welcome as the Protestant, the Jew as the
infidel. It was not necessary for a man to have
been a member of our League, though of course
we feel that the League can but prove a most
helpful preparation for the Home. Another
strict rule that the men have very deeply appreciated
is the exclusion of the public. From the
first, we wished the sacredness of their home
privacy to be respected. All too long have these
our friends been marked men, pointed out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
associated with their crimes and made to feel that
they are the lawful prey of the morbidly curious.
The rule was therefore made that no one who
had not served at least one term in prison was to
have admission to the Home. Very few of our
most intimate friends have ever been there and
they have been selected from among those who,
having known the work within prison walls, were
somewhat acquainted with the men. We have
no public meetings at Hope Hall. The family
prayers and Sunday services are often attended
by men who have returned for an hour or two's
visit. The testimonies given by such are most
helpful and encouraging, but we do not believe
in inviting the outside world to hear these
one-time prisoners relate the history of their
crimes.</p>

<p>Chancing to pick up a book the other day
which dealt with the reaching of "the submerged,"
I found the following account. A worker amid
these "under-world" scenes had smuggled in
some wealthy and charitably inclined people and
while his poorer guests were eating, he enlightened
and entertained his rich acquaintances as
follows: "This gentleman with the bullet head
very closely cropped, returned home only forty-eight
hours ago, after two years' absence for
harboring mistaken notions of the privileges of uninvited
guests who make stealthy and forcible entrance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
This other gentleman with the foxy face
and furtive eyes has the distinction of being the
cleverest jewel thief in London. As with all
children of genius his demon is at times too
much for him. Would Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; therefore
look to her gems and precious stones? That
slip of a girl in the back recently faced the law
for pocket-picking and in the dock picked the
pocket of the guardian who stood beside her, a
pretty feat which gave rivals a thrill of envy.
Yonder youth with the well anointed head and
the fore-lock curled over his eye is the promising
leader of a band of Hooligans. They could see
the belt buckle gleam at his waist; that buckle
has knocked three men senseless within ten days.
The distinguished looking individual in the corner
with the large aggressive jowl wore the broad
arrow for ten years because of a sportive freak
which an illiberal law construed as manslaughter,
and the man next to him likewise with a striking
countenance stood his trial on a capital charge
and came off unscathed, though moral certainty
was dead against him." Now all this may be
very clever from the pen of a novelist and the
speaking flippantly of crime and criminals may
be looked upon as literary license. The book
in all likelihood will never be read in the "under-world"
where feelings would be outraged by
such a travesty on charity, but when one comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
to the reality, what could be more ghastly than
the treating of one's fellow-men as though they
constituted some strange species to be studied,
exhibited and joked about. On the other hand
the harm is quite as grievous in allowing men to
exploit in testimony before the public the evil
deeds of the past. Let them say all they like
about the love and mercy and power of the
Christ, but let the evil, shameful past be buried in
the grave of the long ago.</p>

<p>Having been in the past for years connected
with a movement that encouraged the recital of
such testimonies, I know of what I speak when
I say that they are harmful, and that talking of
wrong-doing is often the first step to feeling one
can do it again. The shame and humiliation that
should be felt are soon lost to those who talk
much of what they have been, and a spirit of exaggeration
and almost boastfulness takes its
place.</p>

<p>No reporters have been permitted to visit
Hope Hall. I was assured that the accounts I
could thus secure of the work, would be most
helpful and would give our Movement wide public
recognition, if I would consent to waive this
rule. On the other hand it would do incalculable
harm in prison, making the men feel that
the work was done more or less for the advertising
of the Movement, and it would keep from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
us the most self-respecting and earnest of the
men. In this work the foremost thought has
been and must always be the "boys." We view
questions through their eyes, try to enter understandingly
into their feelings and in so doing the
work must be kept on lines that hold their approval
and endorsement.</p>

<p>No discrimination as to crimes is made in the
welcoming of our guests; that is a matter of the
past. Sin is sin, and we do not ask if it has been
little or big, when the sinner has repented. The
number of terms served, the nationality or the
color of the man make to us no more difference
than their creed. All men who come straight
from prison and need Hope Hall are eligible.
When they have come, they are expected to behave
as gentlemen. The rules are only such as
would govern any well regulated family and are
made for the protection of the men against those
who might spoil the peace and comfort of the
Home. We strongly urge silence regarding the
past and as far as possible the forgetting of its
sad memories. During the day all the men able
to work are busy. We have no industries such
as mat or broom making, which we feared would
spoil the home aspect of the place, besides robbing
the men of their ambition to strike out in
work for themselves. They are employed in the
work of the house; some are busy in the laundry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
some at painting, carpentering or building; others
have the important position of cooks; still
there is also the garden, farming and care of
horse and cow to be remembered. The extension
to our building with the twelve new rooms
was built entirely by the men. When there is
no building or farming to be done other occupations
can easily be found.</p>

<p>In the evening they can gather in the music
room to play games, of which we have a good
supply, or to listen to the phonograph or amuse
themselves with songs around the piano. We
have already a rather nice library and those who
wish to read or write quietly in the parlors can
do so, while on summer nights the broad piazzas
offer a quiet, cool and inviting resting-place.
There is no regulation as to the length of stay of
any man who comes to us. Some can obtain
work much more readily than others. The able
bodied laborer and skilled mechanic have the
best chance; in spring time farm hands are in
great demand, while the man who has never done
honest work in his life before or the one who has
been a bookkeeper or held some other position
of trust are the ones most disqualified for the
next new start in life. Many are well able and
willing to work after a week or two weeks with
us; others may need months to strengthen and
nerve them for their life struggle. I was told by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
those who foretold disappointment that I should
have to deal with many men too lazy to work,
who would come and stay at the Home as long
as we would support them. This has not been
my experience. On the contrary the difficulty
has been to instill patience, so anxious are they
to launch out for themselves and prove their sincerity.</p>

<p>I remember the case of a man who came to us
in the early days. He had held a good paying
position in the past before the yielding to temptations
which gave him his term in prison, but of
course that record was now against him. To
work with pick and shovel, however anxious he
was to do so, would have broken him down in a
few days, for his health was wretched. During
his stay with us his conduct was above reproach
and his work in charge of our dining-room was
most systematic and helpful. When he was
graduated, it was to take the position of dish
washer in a restaurant, which he filled faithfully
for over a year. It meant long hours and small
pay, yet he persevered and held the position.
From this he went to a better place in the country.
There the character given him helped him
yet higher and now after six years he is in a fine
position and is receiving good wages. He is
married and is settled in a very comfortable little
home. He feels that it was worth the year of dish-washing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
to climb steadily to the position he now
holds.</p>

<p>Not long since a man came to us who was a
gentleman by education and training, a very
bright and able fellow, whose fall had come by
getting embroiled in corrupt politics and by extravagant,
intemperate living. He thoroughly
learned his lesson in prison, and showed the most
earnest desire to start right in the new life. As
no suitable position opened, his stay at the home
had to be a long one, but each week saw a
marked improvement in his character. Finding
that the officer was in need of a man to take
charge of the laundry, he volunteered and from
early to late was as faithful over the wash tub
and ironing-board as if they had been double
entry or the balancing of office books. He
graduated to a humble position in a big New
York house where we confidently expect him to
rise by his hard work and ability. Though his
salary is as yet small, he writes to us letters full
of contentment and gratitude, showing in every
way that the new spirit has entered into him,
proving clearly that he realizes that life is a thing
that must be made, not merely spent.</p>

<p>To many the Home brings back sweet memories
of a past long lost to them, but perhaps
those to whom it means the most, are those who
have never had much of a home to remember.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
It is to them a revelation, and it is wonderful
to watch the development in disposition and
character that takes place under the new experience.
My secretary was driving away from
Hope Hall after one of the evening gatherings,
and as the carriage turned out of the driveway
into the road, there was a pause that she might
look back at the brightly lighted windows gleaming
hospitably through the shade-trees which so
prettily surround it. After a long look the man
who was driving turned and said, "Ah! you
don't know what this means to us 'boys'; the
Little Mother does not, well as she understands
us. No one can know but an old-timer. I tell
you when you have never had a place in all your
life to call home, it means something to pass
through these gates and say, 'This is <i>my</i> home,'
to go into a room at night and feel, 'This is
<i>my</i> room,' to lie down on a bed of which you can
say, 'This is <i>my</i> bed.'" Then, as they drove on,
he spoke of his past, and coming to the last imprisonment,
which in his case was, I believe, five
or six years, he added: "When the Little Mother
came, I used to go into the chapel and listen with
the other 'boys.' I liked to hear her talk, and I
respected the men who joined the League, but I
did not think of joining or becoming a Christian.
I felt religion wasn't in my line. One day, however,
she said, 'Boys, I've got a home for you.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
That is what first made me think. I said to myself,
'Here is a woman who thinks enough of
me to offer me a home, something I never had
before, and if she cares that much, it is time I
began to care a little myself.' So I began from
that day to try and get ready for my home.
When the day of liberty came, the officer on my
gang said, 'I shall keep your job for you, for we
expect you back before three months are out.'
And no wonder he said it, for I had never been
able to keep out that long before; but this time I
knew it would be different."</p>

<p>A fine tall fellow walked into my office years
ago, and the greeting that he would have spoken
died on his trembling lips. He could only hold
my hand in his, and battle with the tears that unnerved
him. When he had taken his seat by my
desk, and I had told him how glad I was over his
home-coming, he said, "Little Mother, I don't
know what I should do, were it not for Hope
Hall to-day. I am so confused and bewildered
by the rush of the great city. So strange to outside
life I feel as helpless as a new-born child."
Truly he was unnerved. The trembling hand,
the nervous start at every sound, the stammering
tongue all told the tale too painfully for any mistake.
He was not naturally a nervous, emotional
man. There was nothing weak or cowardly about
him. I was told by companions who had known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
him that he was a most desperate criminal; nothing
thwarted him in his past deeds, even if he
had to force his point with the threatening muzzle
of a revolver. He was a man of education, could
speak and write several languages, was a thorough
musician and had much talent and ability in other
lines, but he had misused his gifts and had become a
notoriously successful forger. Though for years
an infidel he had proved himself an earnest
Christian as a member of our League and
naturally he turned to us after an experience of
fifteen years within the walls. The prison from
which he came was one from which no part of
the surrounding town can be seen. The high
walls and close confinement bury the men absolutely
from the world they have left. From years
of service, he was turned out to face life with but
one dollar as capital with which to start in honest
living. In his case the warden supplemented the
bill with five dollars from his own pocket, which
however the man lost in his confusion and hurry
at the station. I am glad to add that when I
brought the matter to the notice of the governor,
and told him that our prisoners were being sent
forth into the world in that state, with absolutely
no means between them and starvation, he saw to
it that better provision was made for them; but
even where five or ten dollars is given, it is a very
slender barrier between the one-time criminal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the temptations of the old life. The money is
soon spent for food, lodging and car fare hither
and thither, as they seek work, and what then
can they do if they do not find employment?
In many stores and factories the men are not
paid until the end of the second week after
obtaining employment, and during those two
weeks while working, they must have money for
food and lodging. The man of whom I have
just spoken went to Hope Hall and remained
there until he was thoroughly able to cope with
life. He has since held a position of trust where
he had the control of many men and the oversight
of responsible work. He won the confidence
of all who knew him in the town where
he settled. They backed him in starting in
business for himself and he is now married and
happily settled in life. The prison experience is
six years away in the shadow of the sad almost
forgotten past.</p>

<p>Not long since, the chaplain of Charlestown,
Massachusetts, wrote me of a man whom he
very much wanted me to help. He said he believed
the authorities would give this man a
chance in liberty, if there was some one to vouch
for him. He believed that the man was sincere
and earnest in his desire to do right. He further
stated that the Board whose duty it was to look
into the cases of men who might be paroled had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
expressed their willingness to turn him over to
me, if I were disposed to try him and give him
a chance. Though only forty-six years of age,
this man had spent thirty-one years in prison,
counting a juvenile reformatory as the first place
of incarceration. The last sentence was for
thirty years under the Habitual Criminal Act.
We wrote at once offering to take him to Hope
Hall and the authorities gave him over to us,
thus saving him twelve weary years he would
otherwise have had to serve. He was unnerved
and strangely restless when he first arrived. The
hammock in the sunshine seemed the best place
to put him that first day. In six weeks he was
a new man, physically and mentally; he had
gained fifteen pounds in weight and when I
came across him down on his knees weeding the
flower-beds, the face that looked up into mine
was brown with summer tan and bright with
new hope and courage. It could be truly said
of this man that he had never had a chance.
When his mother died, he told the chaplain he
wished he could weep. He wished there was
one thing in her life that could be a sweet
memory, something he could think of as done
for his good, but there was not one bright spot.
Mother, father, sister and brother are buried in
drunkards' graves and the same curse so wrecked
and ruined his life that in the past he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
there was never to be any escape for him. How
much Hope Hall with its fresh air, quiet surroundings,
good food and cheery companionship
mean to such a man only the men themselves
can understand.</p>

<p>It is difficult in a work of this kind to chronicle
its growth. To us who have been in the
midst of it, the development and improvement,
advance and victory are very evident,
but it would need a carefully-kept journal
of many volumes to impart its history to
others.</p>

<p>The old farmhouse on Long Island has been
altered and enlarged. Old walls and ceilings
have been torn down to be replaced by new
plaster and paint. The new wing has given us a
longer dining-room for our increased family, new
kitchens, laundry and storeroom, with overhead
a number of new bedrooms. The farm which
was somewhat of a wilderness has been put
under cultivation; fruit trees, rose-bushes, vines
and shrubs added each spring and fall. Each
addition means much to us, far more than if we
had had large capital to expend. This Home is
not only for the "boys" of New York State, but
for all the Eastern prisons. They come to us
as readily from Charlestown and Trenton as
from Sing Sing. Even the prisons we have not
visited send to us some, who through the reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of the <i>Gazette</i> have come to realize that they too
are welcome.</p>

<p>The Western Home in Chicago has meanwhile
been doing a splendid work for the "boys"
from Joliet and the middle Western prisons.
There we have men mostly on parole; men who
would have no chance of getting their parole were
it not that we are willing to be sponsors for them.
We find them work, keep in touch with them
month by month, and report to the prison, until
we have the pleasure of handing them their final
discharge papers.</p>

<p>The third Hope Hall is in Iowa, and has been
founded and given to the "boys" of that state by
our dear friend and co-laborer, Hon. L. S. Coffin.
Mr. Coffin was one of the pioneers of the state
and a large land owner. For a lifetime he has
been earnest in temperance work and has proved
himself especially the friend of the railroad men.
Sometime since, his heart went out to the "boys"
in prison. He met and talked with me about
the work and expressed his longing to see a Hope
Hall opened for them in his state. Being convinced
of the wisdom and success of the Hope
Hall scheme he came to New York to study our
Home. Going back to Iowa he dedicated the
choicest piece of his own farm to this purpose
and built upon it, at a cost of over ten thousand
dollars, a beautiful home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>I went on for the opening of Hope Hall number
three and shall never forget the scene.
Judges, lawyers, ministers and farmers, the
warden and chaplain of State Prison and the
members of the Prison Board of Control were
all present, and in their midst an old man of over
eighty whose face shone with joy, and whose
voice trembled with emotion, as he realized that
the day for which he had worked so faithfully
single-handed had come at last. When our
League work was started in Iowa, we enrolled
Father Coffin (as he is lovingly called) as a
member of the League, giving him its oversight
for that state. When we think of his energy
and devotion at his advanced age; of the new
and heavy responsibilities he has shouldered in
facing this great problem, we can but feel that he
sets a valiant example that others will follow
some day in the many other states where there
is a similar need.</p>

<p>Statistics are not of very great interest, for
they often fail to convey anything like an idea of
the work accomplished. They are of course added
to as months pass by, so that while the printers
are at work, they have materially changed.
We can say briefly, however, that of those who
have come to our two Hope Halls (Hope Hall
number three is only just opened), seventy-five
per cent. have done well; twenty per cent. may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
be all right, and are often found to be so after
we have apparently lost track of them; five per
cent. have perhaps returned to prison. Over
three thousand have passed through the two
Homes. This of course does not speak of the
many hundreds who were once League members
and are to-day doing well all over the country,
who did not need the shelter and help of Hope
Hall.</p>

<p>The real loving pride the "boys" feel for their
home has been to me very touching. Often
when a man comes to say "good-bye" he can
hardly do so for the tears that make his voice
unsteady, and the first letters are full of homesick
longing for the place that has so truly become
"home, sweet home."</p>

<p>For the graduates who are working within
reach, it is possible to run "home" for a visit
on holidays, and then many happy reunions take
place. On the occasion of our seventh anniversary,
over seventy sat down to supper together.
It had been a very bright sunny day and the
grounds represented a pretty picture. The
teams composed of Home "boys" and graduates
were playing each other on the baseball ground;
little children whose fathers had been given back
to them played in the shade of the big trees;
wives who had come to see the much talked of
starting place that had made all life different to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
their dear ones, walked about the farm or listened
to the music on the broad piazza and from each
glad face and each cheery voice came the same
expression of unutterable thankfulness for what
God had accomplished.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII_THE_SAME_STORY_FROM_OTHER_PENS" id="VIII_THE_SAME_STORY_FROM_OTHER_PENS">VIII<br />
<br />
THE SAME STORY FROM OTHER PENS</a></h2>


<p>The idea of this book has been to show the
subject as far as possible from the standpoint of
the cell. My life has become closely enough
linked with those in prison to see and feel, to
know and understand the problem from their
view-point. I have tried to speak for them.
Now I will let them speak for themselves, that
the touch may be closer and more direct than it
could be through the medium of my thought and
pen.</p>

<p>The following letter was written to the editor
of our <i>Volunteer Gazette</i> in the early days of the
work, by one who had fought his own way out
of difficulty, but who knew well the hard path
that his one-time companions still had to tread.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Editor: I have been reading
much lately in your paper, and also in the daily
papers about the 'Little Mother's' work in providing
a home for the fellow just out of prison.
I am very glad indeed that such a work is being
carried forward, for if ever there existed a class
of men who need looking after it is the ex-prisoner.
I recently attended one of Mrs. Booth's
meetings and was deeply impressed as she made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
plain to her audience the great need of 'her
boys.' It is very probable that I was all the
more interested in view of the fact that I, many
years ago, was sentenced to a term of eighteen
months in the &mdash;&mdash; Penitentiary and to-day,
after the lapse of years, I very vividly recall the
utter friendlessness that was my lot at that time.</p>

<p>"The prison was one in which the prisoners
were compelled to observe the rule of silence;
and my sentence carried with it also the requirements
of hard labor. No person can realize fully
the meaning of such a sentence except he pass
through it. To sit at a work bench day after
day touching elbows with your fellows, not daring
to say a word becomes exquisite torture as
the months pass slowly by.</p>

<p>"I understand that the Little Mother not only
looks after the 'boys' when they come out of
prison, but takes to them a gospel of love and
light and peace. I do not want to disparage the
work done by other Christian workers. God
bless them; they mean well, but some of them
fail to grasp the fact that what we wanted to hear
were words of love and sympathy.</p>

<p>"But what I want to bring out in this is the
decided contrast between coming out of prison
years ago and coming out now.</p>

<p>"The majority of the men confined in that
prison had no hope of being met at the prison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
door by a friend or a relative when the day of
their discharge arrived, and I was one of that
number. When my sentence had expired, I was
given a suit of clothes and a small sum of money,
and was told I was free. So I reentered the
world. Free; but where could I go? My first
thought was to find employment. Need I tell
you of that weary search? I could furnish no
recommendations. The prison pallor showed all
too plainly on my face. The shuffle of the lock-step
still clinging to me, with the instinctive folding
of my arms when spoken to, told plainer than
words where I had last been employed.</p>

<p>"After many days I secured work only to be
dismissed when my employer was warned by a
detective that he was employing an ex-convict.</p>

<p>"Then, at last discouraged, I joined that great
army of men, known as tramps, and for a time I
wandered over the country, living an aimless,
hopeless life. That I am not now a tramp is
due to my having been saved by the precious
blood of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"So much for my experience as an ex-prisoner;
but if reports be true, and if the stories
told me by former associates in crime are to be
believed, there has in the past four years been a
very great change in the attitude of the world
towards the ex-prisoner. A new sentiment has
been formed and where, in my case, practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
no hands were held out to help; now the world
stands ready to help the ex-prisoner, who really
desires to live an honest life once more.</p>

<p>"Years ago no door was open as a home for
the ex-prisoner. To-day Mrs. Booth's three
Hope Halls are spoken of all over this country
of ours where the prison-weary men may find
rest. Indeed I have met and talked with several
of the V. P. L. men and all spoke of 'Home' in
the most endearing terms. I am glad this is the
condition of to-day. The vast majority of men
in prison really desire to live honest lives again.
But they need a champion who will help them
in their new-made resolution, one who will aid
them, while in prison to be true to God and
themselves. One who will meet them at the
prison gate upon their discharge and take them
home. One who will stand between them and
the frown and censure of a world which forgets
that they have already been fully punished for
their misdeeds. One who will aid them in finding
honest employment and to whom they can
always turn for help and counsel. This has in
the past been the problem the prisoners had to
solve. To-day it is no longer a problem.</p>

<p>"And yet it seems to me that the work Mrs.
Booth has undertaken is still in its infancy.
There are still prisons that are unreached. The
serious, thinking world has recognized in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
work the true solution of this mighty problem,
and is grandly rallying to its support.</p>

<p>"I believe the day is fast approaching when
every state shall have its Hope Hall and no man
shall step out of state prison but that he shall
find in one of them a way of escape from the
temptations of crime. God hasten the day."</p>

<p>The next message comes from the pen of one
who can truly be said to have gone through the
bitterness and darkness of prison experience.
In the old days, when prisons were hard, he suffered
for days and nights in the dungeon. He
went through the days of shame and sorrow to
those of bitterness and cynicism and after his
conversion, when liberty became his, he knew
what it was to take up the hardest, most menial
work and do it faithfully and patiently that he
might regain the confidence that the life of
wrong-doing had lost him. To-day these hands
that have been unshackled are stretched out lovingly
to help others and he goes as a messenger
to homes that are bereaved and saddened, to
bring practical help to the little ones of our
"boys" in prison.</p>

<p>Speaking to me of that cry in prison which he
mentions so graphically, he said, "But what is
the use to write about it. The people will not
understand. What we have felt and been
through in prison is a foreign language to them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he told me more in detail how he had
often lain awake in the great still gloomy building
where over a thousand men are locked away
in their narrow little cells. Suddenly in the
darkness and stillness of night, an awful unearthly
shriek will ring out through the galleries&mdash;a cry
that will make the strongest man tremble.
Never in his life elsewhere has he heard anything
so heart-rending and blood-curdling. He
speaks of it as the cry of a soul awake in its anguish,
though the weary body may be in the
torpor of sleep.</p>

<p>"If you ask me what the V. P. L. means I
should say that it is an inspiration to self-help
with Christ as our anchor.</p>

<p>"The need, the crying necessity of this work
can only be entirely known to the man who has
been made over by the grace of God through
the influence of this unique and wonderful work.
The vaporings of alleged scientists have been
taken with all seriousness by some, in derision
by others, according to the ideas of the individuals,
who, placing themselves in the position
of the unfortunates under discussion, tried themselves
and found a true bill or not according to
their faith in themselves. From the adverse reports
it is needless to say that these self-appointed
censors of humanity had a very poor
opinion of themselves and had entirely omitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
God Almighty from the problem. The people
of the world at large who were not scientific, put
down the man behind the bars as 'no good'
and dismissed the subject with indifference, so
that the unfortunate found himself between the
scientist and the world very much in the position
of the man who fell among thieves, and who in a
most desperate condition and sorely needing
help, has been passed by on the other side by the
priest and the Levite. They took a look at him,
examined him and passed along. What the
Good Samaritan means only the subject of the
rescue can know. It is from that point of view
I speak.</p>

<p>"The real punishment of the prisoner commences
after the liberty he has so longed for comes.
The day he looked forward to arrives, he steps
out into the world a man, alone in the crowd,
marked, branded, not entirely alone for he has
chained to him a corpse, his dead past. At the
time that success seems almost in his grasp his
past arises, like an evil spirit and drags him down
in the mire again. So he drifts back to his only
home, the prison. The glamour of his life of
crime, the follies of youth, give way to cynicism,
a feeling of kismet arises that excuses his failures
as being part of a fate that could not be evaded.
Gladly would the man escape the wretched past
and the inevitable future. Sometimes he tries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
every time with less success. The past always
arises. Then his physical condition is gradually
changed, in many cases the habit of drugs, of
opium especially has been acquired. It makes a
man forget&mdash;he needs to forget by now! Again
so-called liberty comes. Where can he go? A
few dollars in his pocket, a cheap suit of clothes
on his back, every one seems to point the finger
at him. The saloon is always open, the woman
with the painted face meets him, a few old chums
are there, and he is welcomed back to Hell.
Perhaps he is successful, turns a few good
'tricks,' puts his 'fall money' away (money to
defend him in case he is arrested and also to
square himself with the police) but sooner or
later it is the old story,&mdash;back again to prison, a
matter of course by now&mdash;but he will be more
careful next time. Sometimes he thinks of the
better days of long ago&mdash;it won't do, he closes
the door with a snap&mdash;he hates himself, he hates
the world, and if you were on the inside in the
dead of night, you too would sometimes hear
that awful cry of the tortured soul&mdash;that involuntary
wail that makes even the night watch
shrink&mdash;the soul crying against its murder while
the body sleeps. Underneath all is that yearning
for a better life. We get sometimes almost on
the edge of the pit only to slip back farther into
the abyss than before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>"You, who have lived in the beautiful country
of home and loved ones, have never heard that
awful cry and you never want to, for, if you did,
you could never forget it.</p>

<p>"The men that the V. P. L. appeals to more
than any others are those who are men of determined
and positive natures, those who are no
longer novices in crime. Strange as it may appear,
these men, if you know them and have their
confidence, will tell you that their life is a mistake,
but that there is no escape. They are
chained to the work. If a strong man can be
faced about, he is just as potent for good as he
once was for evil. The only way to get good
out of a 'given-up' man is by the love of God,
and it must be brought to him by his fellow-creatures
as messengers, but, when he asks for
bread, don't give him a stone. Your man behind
the bars is suspicious. It is not a wonder that
he is, when he is approached on the subject of
help. He naturally wonders where the 'graft'
comes in.</p>

<p>"Now this is what the V. P. L. does. When
the leaders and officers of this glorious work step
forward to speak to the 'boys' they know they
are not in the position of 'the hired man,' that
there is no 'graft' in it, that their lives are lives
of sacrifice. They talk of the love of God to the
men and they prove it. If you want to impress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the men behind the bars, you <i>must</i> prove it&mdash;make
it real, also talk straight. Don't tell them
that they should not be in prison,&mdash;they know
better; don't get sentimental and weep over
them, for they don't want that. The Little
Mother tells them 'I don't come here to prevent
you from paying the just penalty of your crimes;
take your medicine like men. You know what
is right, do it <i>now</i>. When you have paid the
penalty, I will help you. I will nurse you back to
health, I will get you work, above all, I will
trust you and it depends upon you whether I
keep on doing so or not. Mind, I will help you
over rough places, but I won't carry you. If any
of you have little ones, wives or mothers, I will
help them, and as long as you are true and faithful,
I will help you.' 'What then?' you ask.
Well the Little Mother makes good her promise,
she does all this and more. In extending her
invitation to the country of the good Hope she
says, 'I want you all to come. I don't care
what your religion is or what your color is.
All I ask is that you turn away from the old
life.'</p>

<p>"Starving wives and little children are fed and
clothed. No man in state prison ever applied
for aid for his suffering loved ones in vain.
When you save a man's loved ones from a fate
often worse than death, he does not doubt your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
sincerity, when you give instead of take all the
time, he believes you.</p>

<p>"Then he comes out of prison broken down
with the nervous strain&mdash;the nights of anguish&mdash;his
confidence in himself is gone. Nothing but
the old life of Hell in front of him, a branded
man, but the doors of Hope Halls are open!
'<span class="smcap">Welcome</span>' is on the door-step. Does he
find some ill-smelling building with whitewashed
walls that remind him of the place he has just
left, abundance of advice and nothing to eat?
Not at all! He enters a beautiful Home such as
any gentleman in the land might be proud of, institutionalism
is lacking&mdash;Home and loving sympathy
greet him, dainty rooms with whitest of
sheets upon nattiest of beds, an air of comfort
and repose, beautiful grounds, kindness and helpfulness
on every hand. Hope has its resting-place
here. On the walls of one of the restful
rooms in an illuminated text are these words,
'Christ is the head of this House, the unseen
listener to every conversation.'</p>

<p>"The one who has saved the babies and the
mothers is equally successful with the man who
comes Home. Every man is on honor. The
farm and household duties, the care of the beautiful
grounds give enough exercise to occupy the
time though there is no particular task. Each
one is interested in his Home. After the day is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
over there is the large library, music, games, etc.
As the days go by, the man broken down by
long imprisonment improves in body and mind.
The living in God's sunshine helps body and
soul. The terrible nervousness gives place to
confidence, the prison pallor goes gradually, the
good that has been sown brings forth fruit, the
door is shut upon the past&mdash;tided over at the
critical point&mdash;our comrade, ruddy in health and
strong in spirit, is placed in a position. His past
is known to one man&mdash;his employer. How different
from all past attempts! No one can throw
him down so long as he does well. The one
who hires him will defend him and the Little
Mother is his friend, and his comrades cheer
him on.</p>

<p>"The story I've told is the same one three
thousand made-over men can tell to-day. The
V. P. L. has long since left the realms of theory
for the stronghold of facts. The finest sermon
preached in a man's life, the touchstone of our
League is this, 'If a man is right, he will do
right.'"</p>

<p>I must not forget the life-men in prison. If it
were only for them, it would be well worth while
to have our League established, that on their
horizon otherwise so dark and gloomy, might be
seen some breaking of the dawn that shall bring
to them a brighter, sweeter life, when the full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
penalty has been paid and they pass into a world
where the sweetest and fullest of liberty shall be
theirs.</p>

<p>One of these life-men writes as follows:&mdash;"Dear
Little Mother:&mdash;Nobody knows better
than I do myself what the League has done for
me and the men here. I have been in prison
over twenty years, and know what I am talking
about. Without it prison would be much like
what it was before. I hope that with all the disappointments
you are bound to meet with, you
will continue to believe that there are hundreds
of men in our great prisons who are in earnest.
Most respectfully yours, No. 19595."</p>

<p>The following is written by one of our graduates
who was for some years a member of the V.
P. L. He did not himself need the shelter of
Hope Hall, but he knew well what the Home was
to those who were homeless. He is now a successful
business man, has a happy home of his
own and is a leader in the church to which he
belongs, being the superintendent of the Sunday-school
and much interested in all the active work
of that little community.</p>

<p>"Dear Little Mother:&mdash;Word has reached me
that you are completing a book telling the glorious
story of the Volunteer Prison League and I
am led to write you this expression of my joy
that there is thus to be given to the world, something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
of the truth which you so well know of the
real heart of the prisoner-man. Not only this,
but after the passage of more than three years
since I left prison, I want to bear this renewed
testimony to you of the penetrating, permeating
and abiding power of our loved League, to give
and to hold hope and faith in the souls of disheartened,
sinful, but contrite men.</p>

<p>"No good which has come to me in these prospering
days of freedom, and no gladness which
still unlived years may have in store for me, can
ever dim in my grateful heart, the memory of
what this League has done for me, and what I
have seen it do for others in leading us out of
despondency, imbuing us with courage, giving
us strength to stand erect and in guiding us back
to Christ and to God.</p>

<p>"Only those who have been face to face with
the conditions of prison life, who know its revolting
influences, who have daily breathed its debasing
atmosphere, who have felt its contaminating
touch, to whom has come the ever deepening
sense of social degradation and of the repellent
stigma placed indelibly upon them by their
prison term can realize what the League means.
They whose quickened consciences have scourged
them unto the wish and the will to retrieve the
sinful past, only to be hurled back into deeper
disheartenment and desperation by the popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
prejudice which questions their ability and almost
denies them the rights to restoration, can fully
appreciate the moral uplifting and incentive
which this League gives. No words can express
the tortures of the first awful days in prison.
The isolation, the remorse, the heart-hardening
power of stern discipline which regulates diet and
toil, waking and sleeping and which sharply
limits free-will and free-act; the dread consciousness
that you are henceforth to be classed among
social outcasts and forever mistrusted and distrusted
are all part of an unspeakable whole.
The association with the multitude of like conditioned
men whose lengthened terms of confinement,
and whose repeated convictions perhaps
have given them a fixed sense of indifference to
what happens to themselves and what they bring
to pass upon others, and from whose forbidding
experience you learn the awful truth of the fate
which confronts you as a convicted man, and
from which they insist there is no sure escape,
however sincere and earnest the purpose and the
striving, soon makes most prisoners hopeless,
and many of them heartless. Is it any wonder?</p>

<p>"Such was the atmosphere and such the invariable
impression and effect of prison life when I
was justly condemned and confined. I found
men all about me longing for a fair new chance
to live aright, but impregnated with the doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
that there was now no hope for them to do so.
There were men of all types and all classes of
social condition. Men serving their first term
and others serving their second, third&mdash;or fourth&mdash;who
in the confidence and candor of our mutual
misery and degradation often told me (for we do
communicate readily in prison, you know) that
their supreme desire was for a return to decent
citizenship, that they wanted to be 'straight'
but that there was no chance for them to be so
for <i>no one would trust them</i>.</p>

<p>"I was amazed to find among the most 'hardened'
of my fellow-prisoners this controlling
soul-thirst for confidence, for faith, and for trust.
There was practically no rebellion against physical
features of imprisonment and of prison discipline,
there was no protest against the severity
of the material pains and penalties of our punishment,
but we yearned mightily for unselfish
brotherly love and treasured to a degree unknown
to those to whom it has never been denied, such
fractions thereof as we received from each other.
What was needed and all that was needed to give
us the true impetus, the sufficient incentive, the
conquering power to adjust ourselves anew and
to set our lives in the right way for future freedom,
was some agency which by stimulating unselfish
love among ourselves and showing us that
we were likewise loved by Christly men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
women outside the prison walls, should inspire us
to then and there have faith in God, to then and
there have faith in our fellow-men and to then
and there live loyally to the truth and the law.</p>

<p>"This agency came to us in the organization of
this League in our prisons. Adherence to its
principles quickened us to newness of life, gave
us confidence in ourselves and others and taught
us definitely and unequivocally that it is that
which is wrought within a man, and not that
which is wrought upon a man, that makes a man,
and determines what he is, irrespective of where
he is. When he had learned that truth we were
all right. From that hour the fact of our conviction
lost its sovereign sway, our imprisonment
was seen to be a new beginning and not the final
ending of our social careers and the future
glowed brightly for us with hopes sure to be
realized if only we remained steadfast.</p>

<p>"And we are remaining steadfast, Little Mother,
hundreds of us, and by God's grace we will hold
true to the end, and it is because this League has
so thoroughly imbedded its truths in our hearts
and is thereby daily shaping our lives, that so
many of us are conquering in prison and out of
prison and that we so revere you and love it.</p>

<p>"The crowning factor in the work of the League
beyond prison walls, and the one feature which
fulfills its promise of continuing love and health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
until each discharged man is so conditioned that
he needs such help no longer, is Hope Hall. I
did not have occasion to go there except as a
guest on Anniversary Day, but I tell you what I
know of its value to those who have no place
else to go except the street, the den and the dive.</p>

<p>"The average man in stripes, when he is freed
of the law, has no spot he can feel or know as his
home. There is no available resting-place where
he can abide with cordial welcome and with provision
made for his every need during the weeks
or months when he is regathering his physical
and mental powers, more or less shattered by his
years in confinement and sorrow, and until he
finds the steady employment that will give him
the means of self-support.</p>

<p>"To such men this haven afforded by Hope
Hall is a veritable salvation for body and soul.
Scores have shown me how their repeated convictions
were brought about by the fact that they
were homeless and friendless, except for evil associates,
and in dire need after their former imprisonment
and they cursed conditions that made
them convicts again and again.</p>

<p>"I have seen these same men, awakened to the
truth that Hope Hall was theirs and for them
and them alone, shed tears of appreciation as
they spoke of their finding shelter when they
were again free and thus avoiding the possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of a return to evil ways. I have seen some of
these men, who later graduated from this home
into useful lives, wholly redeemed by its final
service to them, without which the previous work
in their souls would have been wasted.</p>

<p>"There is no power quite so strong upon the
human heart as that which centres about one's
home and it is because these otherwise homeless
men have come to look upon it and to call our
Hope Hall their home and who love it accordingly,
that they there find the calm, the comforting
and the safety they require to make them
wholly sound in body and soul and they can
afterwards go into other homes they themselves
establish strong to endure and overcome.</p>

<p>"God bless you and our League and make you
both the means and the power unto salvation of
thousands more of the men among whom I am
now forever numbered, until the whole world
shall recognize the regnant truth that men in
stripes are also the loved children of God, and are
both subdued and energized by the same Divine
power which moves upon the souls of other men
and with like results."</p>

<p>The next opinion is from a talented and educated
man, who has thoughtfully and dispassionately
written of what he has seen during the past
six years as an inmate of the prison where our
League started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"In making an estimate of the influence and
value of the Volunteer Prison League in prison,
based upon favorable opportunities for observation,
I should say that its appeal at first was in
its promise of material aid, and its spiritual influences
came after. When Mrs. Booth came to
Sing Sing, the men were unprepared for the ringing
message that she brought them and for her
promises of substantial aid. At first, they didn't
believe it. It was too good to be true, and she
might have prayed and preached to them till
Doomsday, without securing anything more than
passing attention, had she not coupled her plea
for spiritual reform with an offer of help of the
most practical kind. Their interest was aroused
and when these offers took real form and man
after man went to Hope Hall, got help and employment,
she gained admission to their hearts
and confidence and the field was ready for the
spiritual effort which has, I believe, been successfully
made.</p>

<p>"These results are not altogether based upon
gratitude, nor are they merely emotional, but in
many cases they are real and permanent. There
are scores of prisoners in Sing Sing who are
making sincere efforts to lead pure, Christian
lives and who are supported in their aspirations
by the work of the League. These men are the
most hopeful subjects of permanent reform, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
there are also many others who are moved by the
influences of the League, attracted by the decencies
and respectability that it offers and by its
material support, who are also genuinely in
earnest and furnish many cases of the restoration
of hitherto hopeless men returning to society as
useful members. The spiritual influence is not
so active with them, but they acknowledge that
such influences do exist and their attitude is
respectful to them, whereas before the establishment
of the League they were contemptuous and
scornful. This is hopeful material to work upon,
and from it Mrs. Booth will undoubtedly gather
a large number of complete converts.</p>

<p>"It is a fact that in the past the men were not
only apathetic and indifferent to religious teachings,
but they entertained a positive aversion to
them. That is largely changed. It is still true
with a considerable number, but even with them
the truculence has passed away and the attitude
of the whole community is at least respectful and
with a majority, appreciative of the League's
work. I saw both conditions during my six
years' imprisonment and the change is marked in
a hundred ways. When the League button was
first worn by a few men, they were the subjects
of open scorn by their fellow-prisoners. Now
the button is worn by a large majority of the
prisoners with pride, and no one of those who do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
not wear it ever thinks of making a slurring or adverse
comment upon them. At first, it was
frequently said, in that free spirit of criticism that
prevails among prisoners, 'Oh, yes, Mrs. Booth
is in it for what it will bring, like the rest.' Now
it would be dangerous for a man to make such a
remark openly. He would be called to prompt
account for his insulting speech. In fact, such
things are not said any more.</p>

<p>"The members of the League, on joining, make
a promise to abstain from obscene language and
profanity. The effect of this principle in the
constitution of the League is perhaps more apparent
than any other. Oaths are less frequently
heard and vile speech is far less common. It has
become bad form to swear, and clean conversation
is supplanting the ribald talk that prevailed among
the men before the League's influence manifested
itself.</p>

<p>"The verdict of the prisoners upon the work of
the League is unanimous that it is the only real
and practical scheme of help that has ever been
extended to them. There is no varying opinion
about its effectiveness. They recognize its value.
It has opened the way for hundreds of wretched
men who turned from the contemplation of their
future with despair, but who now regard it with
hope. The stories that come back from Hope
Hall, and from the many men who have secured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
employment and who are leading clean and useful
lives, have passed from lip to lip, and every
one gives new encouragement and supports new
resolutions of reform.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Booth's and Mrs. McAlpin's friendship
has had another influence upon the prisons, an
indirect one it is true, but one of great significance
for the prisoner. It is useless to deny that the
discipline of prisons has been marked at times by
cruelty and tyranny. Such conditions are responding
to a progressive spirit, and a factor in
that movement is the fact that these victims of the
old abuses are no longer friendless. They are able
to make a complaint, and they understand that
their welfare will be guarded by those capable of
protecting it. The work on these lines is subjective
but potent. Similarly, the discipline has
been helped by the organization. The officials
recognize that fact. Men are more biddable,
officers, less arrogant. The prisoner and keeper
have become more considerate of each other.
There has been a vast change and improvement
in every way. The prisoner, having found a real
incentive, is seeking to lift himself up, and as he
shows himself worthy of aid by those entrusted
with the control of his actions, they are encouraged
to help him. How far these good influences may
extend, I am unable to say. It may be that they
will even reach a solution of the problems presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
by crime, but if they do not go so far, they
are working with the cordial, grateful, earnest
coöperation of the prisoners themselves, without
which all efforts would be vain."</p>

LIFE STORIES</a></h2>


<p>How strong and vivid an impression some
pictures can make upon the mind, photographed
there in colors so striking or so appealing to the
soul, that all through life they come back to
memory again and again as clear and sharp in
every detail as the day we first gazed upon them!
Perhaps it was the wondrous work of some master
hand that stood out for us as the one picture in
a gallery of treasures. It may have been a face
that gazed at us from the shadowy corner of an
old cathedral through which the very thought
and soul of the painter met our own, and left
with us the meaning that he strove to teach
through form and color. That which lives the
longest may perchance be a crude picture that
hung on the nursery wall, weaving itself into our
childish life, and wearing for us a different aspect
when we were good or naughty. The firelight
played mysteriously about it as we dozed off to
sleep, and then perhaps it took life and mingled
with our childish dreams. If we are lovers of
nature, the brightest, most living pictures in
memory's gallery may have come to us amid the
whisper of leaves and the play of sunbeams.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Some little glade where the shadows wavered on
ferns and moss, or the tiny streamlet whose
pearly waters caught the sunbeams and glittered
like gems amid the lace work of the leaves.
The photograph was taken by the eye and
brain long years ago, but we have seen the
picture again and again. When the earth has
been hard and cold in the icy grip of winter, as
we have travelled over the thirsty desert, or when
counting the weary hours in the dark room
where fever held us, it has come back so clearly
that we have almost heard the laughter of the
water and the rustle of the leaves. I wish instead
of trying to paint with words, I could use
the pencil and brush of a master hand to show a
picture that made just such an impression on my
mind, and that, if seen by others, would bring to
them without words the thought, the truth of
which no argument could gainsay.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant May morning, such a day as
sets the birds singing and drapes the apple-trees
with masses of pink and white. The sky was a
vivid blue and great piles of cotton-wool cloud
floated leisurely across the distance as if to show
up the tender reds and greens of the foliage.
The glory of the day without made the contrast
greater as I stepped within the walls of one of
our oldest and gloomiest state prisons. As the
great iron door shut behind me, gone were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
sunshine, the breezes, the gladness and song of
the spring, for sorrow and sighs seemed to lurk
in the dark corners. A few minutes later, I
found myself on the chapel platform, looking
down on an audience garbed in the dreary striped
uniform that was in itself enough to add gloom
to the sombreness of prison walls and high barred
windows. The room was so built that not much
of the brightness of out-of-doors penetrated it and
the contrast between the country through which
I had passed, and this sunless place was very
striking. As the opening exercises proceeded, I
studied my audience. An audience means much
to the speaker, and especially is this true of one
in State Prison. There were some whom I had
known for several years and the smile of recognition
meant much to them; others had come
since my last visit, and I needed to know them
that I might learn to reach their hearts with the
message. Of these newcomers, some were mere
boys whose heads were bowed in shame; others
showed a bitter and defiant front and appeared
to be flinging out a challenge to any who might
dare approach the portal of their imprisoned
soul.</p>

<p>It was while engaged in this study of faces
that I saw the picture of which I would speak.
In the roof of the chapel was a small sky-light,
and through it the sun sent down one bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
clear shaft of yellow glory. It shone on one
man, making his face and figure stand out distinctly
amid the gloom that surrounded him.
Looking at the face, I saw at once that his was
the type the criminologists would pick out as a
hardened offender. There was the stern jaw, the
deep-set dark eyes, on his face the lines that
rough life had given and the prison pallor that
told of long years within the walls, made all the
more noticeable by the mass of black hair that
fell low on his brow. There was much of past
suffering to be read in that face, but now utterly
forgetful of his surroundings, he had thrown his
head back and was looking straight up into the
glory of the sunshine. The mouth that might
have been stern and cynical was smiling, and as
I looked the dark eyes were softened with a
mist of tears, and then as they overflowed, the
sunlight shone and glistened upon them as they
coursed their way down his face. These were
the words he was singing, and the whole expression
of that face told that they came not
from the lips alone, but from a heart that knew
that of which it sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Thee all the follies of sin I resign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art Thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Could I have caught the spirit of the picture and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
shown that face in the sunlight with the soul's
door thrown open, with the convict garb amid
the setting of gloomy shadows, and had I had
the power to make it live on canvas I would have
hung it where the passing world could read its
story. No need to write beneath it! Could
they have seen it as I saw it, they would have
turned away to say, "So there <i>is</i> hope for the
convict." Hope! Yes, indeed! That is what
I am reading day by day in the life experiences
of our "boys" in prison. That is the message
that is being sent back in louder, more certain
tones from the lives of thousands who have stood
the test of liberty. In a work like ours, the happy,
hopeful side is what gives us courage to face the
hard, stern difficulties that cannot be slighted or
forgotten, but must from their very urgency be
faced and combated. It is the flesh and blood
facts, not the theories, that will prove to the
world the redeemability of those who have gone
far astray, and it is this very evidence that I wish
to bring forward.</p>

<p>One hot summer day in 1896, shortly after the
opening of our work in prison, and before Hope
Hall was in existence, a caller came to my office
who bore in face and manner the most unmistakable
brand of State Prison. My secretary was
the first to greet him, but she almost immediately
came to my private office, and in her hands she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
carried a sand bag, a revolver and a handful of
cartridges. "He has come to give you these,"
she said, and so I called him in at once to tell me
his story. He was a tall, stoop-shouldered fellow,
whose whole figure spoke of dejection and a
broken spirit. His face had the distrustful,
hunted look that speaks of years of experience
with every man's hand against one. After I had
welcomed him and tried to make him feel how
truly glad I was that he had turned to us in his
extremity, I drew him on to talk of himself.
The feverishness of the hand, that had clasped
mine, the unnatural brightness of the sunken
eyes, and the pain with which his face was
drawn made his tale all the more pathetic.
When our work was opened in Sing Sing, he
had refused to leave his cell to attend the service.
He was an old-time prisoner, having been in
prison several times and he had reached the
point where his heart was hardened against
everything. He had absolutely given up faith in
religion. Though he had never heard us speak,
he received something of the message from the
other men. Sitting alone in his cell during the
last few weeks of his incarceration, he thought
seriously over the utter failure of his life. He
was thoroughly tired of prison, there was no
doubt of that, but could there be any other life
for him? Something that I had said concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
my faith and hope for the "old-timer" came as
an encouragement in this hour of decision, and
he finally determined to have done with the
crooked life and to give honest living one good,
fair trial.</p>

<p>On leaving prison he did not come to our
Headquarters; he had never met us and did not
feel that he had any claim, so he faced his problem
alone and sought to find work for himself.
Though a tall, large-boned man, he was far from
strong, for long terms in prison had told upon
him and the seeds of that wretched "prison consumption"
that used to be so prevalent in Sing
Sing, had already found fertile soil in his lungs.
The first weeks represented weary hours of
tramping back and forth through the city asking
for work, only to meet the same disappointment
everywhere. At last he found a job on Long
Island at the work of putting up telegraph poles.
Wet weather came and he caught a violent cold.
The heavy work by day, with the fever and pain
at night, told on him in time and his courage
failed. He saw that he could not work on at that
job much longer and if he broke down, what
then? Well! he supposed he must do something
for a living, and there was one line of work
at which he knew he was an expert, so he turned
back the good leaf and gave up the struggle.
He came to the city and purchased the implements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
of an evil trade. The sand bag he made
to be used in highway robbery and the other
weapon was to take his own life if he should be
detected in the crime. He was a desperate man,
desperate with that desperation that comes only
to those who have tried to do right and found
it a failure. The whole outlook is infinitely
darker for the defeated man than for the one
who is carelessly drifting. At nightfall, he went
out to watch for his prey, but unknown to him
the angel of the Lord was with him and he surely
heard that voice behind him say, "This is the
way, walk ye in it," when he tried to turn to
"the left hand or the right." God's restraining
influence he did not recognize, for he knew and
cared nothing for God. He told me that an unaccountable
something stopped him every time,
and then some words that I had spoken in prison,
though he had only received them at second
hand, rang in his ears. I do not know what they
were, but it was one of those instances where the
bread cast upon the waters comes back after
many days to bear its unexpected fruit, like
the grains of rice that whirl in the waters of the
Nile and some day find a lodgment, and rear
above the muddy stream the harvest of future
blessing. So the dreary long night through, that
fight between good and evil raged, and all the
time the weary feet tramped the city streets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
When morning came, afraid of himself, despairing
and desperate, he turned to us and asked me to
take the weapons that only meant to him temptation.
Hope Hall was not opened then, but we
were looking for a house and I told him of our
plans, assuring him of a hearty welcome when
there should be a place for him to come to. It
was wonderful how cheering words and human
sympathy seemed to encourage him. Once
more he began to hope for himself, and a firmer,
more determined expression chased away that
of miserable despair. After we received from
him the promise that he would still try and do
right at any cost, we advised him to return to
the work on Long Island, telling him we would
send for him at the earliest possible moment.
He took a copy of the little Day Book which
he was to read with us morning and evening as
a reminder of his promise, and each day he wrote
just a line to say how things went with him.
That somebody cared, seemed to make all the
difference in the world to this struggling soul.
He had refused to take any money from us as he
had some of his earnings left, and he was far too
independent to wish to secure that kind of aid.
His letters showed a spirit of bravery despite difficulties,
and the greatest gratitude for the little
we had been able to do for him.</p>

<p>Just as soon as Hope Hall was rented and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
officer put in charge, we telegraphed for this
"boy," and he became the first inmate. He
turned to with a will at floor scrubbing, window
cleaning and painting, taking the liveliest interest
in preparing the home for those who
would soon be free to claim it. As new "boys"
came, he was ever ready with a loving word of
welcome. In a few weeks, he found Christ as
his Saviour and then the greatest change took
place in the whole man. The crushed, hunted,
distrustful look vanished, the hopeless stoop left
his shoulders and with head held high, he had
now courage to look the world in the face,
while the eyes were bright with joy that had before
expressed such pathetic despair. He took
so much interest in the Home that he was made
Sergeant, and remained in that position until he
left us to take a place in open air work as a
brakeman on the cable cars. He worked faithfully
and honorably at this occupation until his
last illness, which was sudden and short. He
died in the home of Christian friends whom he
had met while at Hope Hall, and who gave him
the loving sympathy which he so needed in that
last hour. His own mother had refused to see
him or own him, since his return from prison.
She did not even come to his deathbed, for
when her heart at last relented, it was too late;
she could only sob over the coffin of the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
who had so longed to see her and had been
denied. "Is it true that &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; went to
your place and became honest?" asked an
officer of me in Sing Sing, and when I told him
the story of this changed life, he said, "Well, I
would never have thought it possible. He was a
criminal through and through and we certainly
expected to see him back here to die."</p>

<p>I entered my office one morning to find a very
worn and travel-stained wanderer awaiting me.
He was a tall, raw-boned man, with a face that
perhaps the criminologists would have liked to
classify. The stern line of jaw denoted fighting
propensities; his eyes had the furtive, hunted
look of one accustomed to being suspected and
across brow and cheek was an ugly scar. A
more dejected, hard looking fellow could not well
have been imagined and the worn-out shoes and
dust covered clothing were fully explained when
he told me his story.</p>

<p>He had been a crook ever since he had been
old enough to gain his living and having had no
home influence, but that which was evil, and no
teaching to lead him to the right path, the wrong
one was very faithfully followed to his own ruin.
He had had several imprisonments and when the
League was started in Charlestown, he was in
the last year of his term. He did not make any
religious profession, nor did he connect himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
with our organization, but he did gather a
vague inspiration for a better future. He determined
that he would go out to try and find
honest work. This he sought to do before appealing
to us, having the mistaken idea that he
had no claim upon us, because he had not joined
our League. He had never done honest work
in his life, and little did he realize how hard it
would be to find it. But those first days of unsuccessful
effort opened his eyes to the difficult
road he must tread. With no trade, no character,
no references, no friends, and with the
criminal past stamped on face and manner, how
was he ever to get the much needed first chance,
and yet he did want to try and be honest. His
appearance was certainly against him, and when
his money was gone, the outlook was most discouraging.
Just at this point the policeman
acted the part of fate and "ran him in," not because
he had committed any crime, but to prevent
him from doing so. He looked suspicious
as he walked about seeking for work, and so
naturally was thought to be on mischief bent.</p>

<p>That night when the door of a cell clanged
behind him and he looked around on the narrow,
confining walls, a deep realization of his failure
swept over him. "Prison, prison, is it always
and forever to be prison?" he groaned and
throwing himself on his knees, for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
in his life he prayed. It was the desperate
prayer of a man who had come to the end of his
own resources. He simply swore to God that if
He would help him out of this difficulty, he
would give Him his life and start right afterwards.
How many have made like vows in the
dark, to forget them straightway when the sunshine
is given unto them again! The next day
in court when he feared at least some months of
imprisonment because of his past record, some
one unknown to him said a good word in his
behalf, and he was discharged. He left the court
room with but one thought and that was to make
straight for Hope Hall. He had no money and
knew no one who could help him, but he felt that
he had but the one hope left. The man who has
lived by his wits is not of the beggar class; the
thief and the criminal can show stern resolution
and suffer much privation in the new life, but they
will not beg. This man walked from Boston to
New York, and when I had heard the story very
simply told in his own rough way, he turned and
said with a pleading pathos which no words
could convey, "Now Little Mother, will you give
me a chance? Is there any hope for me?"
There was no insincerity or treachery in those
dark eyes as he asked the question, but a beseeching
anxiety as if on the answer hung life or
death. Very gladly did we bid him welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and he became a very happy and intensely appreciative
member of the Hope Hall family.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget his face as he said a few
farewell words to his comrades the night before
his graduation from the Home. He was still the
angular, awkward fellow; there were still the stern
jaw and the disfiguring scar, but despite them,
the face was wonderfully changed and as he
spoke with the deepest feeling of the new life
that had come to him, his countenance was so
lit up with joy and peace that it appeared transfigured.
It was hard work he undertook, but he
was a proud man each morning, as he arose at four
o'clock and started out to gain an honest living
with the certainty in his heart that he was making
a success of it. When the first pay day came,
he called at my office, coming in straight from
work in toil-stained clothing, and with his hands
bearing the marks of toil which mean so much
to us. I was occupied at the time and my secretary
demurred at disturbing me, but he insisted
he wanted only a moment. As I rose to greet
him, he clasped my fingers in his two strong
hands and with tears filling his eyes he said,
"Little Mother, I just came to thank you. I
can't tell you what the Home has meant to me
but I want my comrades to know I am really
grateful." And then he drew from his pocket a
little roll of bills and pressing it into my hand he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
said, "That is the first honest money I ever
earned. I want you to use it for the 'boys' who
are now where I was once." As I smoothed out
the fifteen crumpled dollar bills, their value to me
was far beyond that inscribed upon them, for
they would have refuted the prognostications of
those who told me of the ingratitude which I
should meet and the worthlessness of the treasure
for which I was seeking in the dark mines of
state prison.</p>

<p>Within our prison walls there are naturally
many men of foreign birth, some of them very
ignorant of our language, coming from the illiterate
classes even in their own land. In some
cases they have drifted into trouble, some from
ignorance more than intentional criminality,
while many are of the helpless, shiftless classes
who do well enough when sternly governed
but are very poor masters of their own life
and destiny. Herded together in the great
slum sections of our large cities, their surroundings
on the outside prove a very hotbed of evil.
Friendless and unable to make themselves understood,
many of them have a very poor showing
in the court-room and after their term expires, go
out into an unwelcoming world with no chance
of escaping recurring troubles in the future.</p>

<p>On one of my early visits to Clinton, the
third prison in New York, I was spending a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
day in interviews. I believe there were over
seventy names on the list who had specially
asked to see me. The warden had very kindly
placed his private office at my disposal, and he
himself introduced each newcomer, then leaving
us alone that the man might confide in me what
he wished concerning his needs or those of his
loved ones. Hour after hour passed quickly and
towards the end of the day the warden introduced
a very forlorn-looking man by a name
which was almost unpronounceable. It was his
own name undoubtedly. No man could have
happened on such an alias. As I stepped forward
to greet my visitor, the warden passed out
behind him but I caught a merry twinkle in his
eye that made me guess something was amusing
him. My secretary afterwards reported that
when he reached the next room, he told her the
joke. He had introduced to me a Greek, whose
English was as mysterious as his own language
and my interview was likely to be somewhat one-sided.
I certainly found it so. That my new
friend was very forlorn and unhappy was plain,
that he needed sympathy and comfort was evident,
but the only words I could understand despite
his most conscientious and voluble efforts
were these, "Me poor man, me no friends."
Between other remarks delivered with sighs and
entreaties, those words always remained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
tenor of his thought. I assured him with word
and gesture I would gladly be his friend, but beyond
that I could convey little comfort, so I just
sat and smiled on him, and fortunately a smile is
the same in all languages. When our interview
came to an end and he departed to his cell, I was
inclined to believe it had been fruitless and that
I had given him no possible help.</p>

<p>On my next visit some months later, lo and
behold! my Greek's name appeared once more
on the list. This time he impressed me again
with the sad news of his friendless condition
but added, for he knew a little more English,
that he wanted to be good and managed to
convey to me the information that he was praying
for God's help. That time we prayed together
to the One who understands the language
of the heart whatever words the tongue may
utter, and after a few more smiles and a number
of efforts at coherent conversation, we parted.
At my next interview I saw a very marked
change in my friend. His face had lost its forlornness
and he pointed very proudly to the little
V. P. L. button he wore on his striped suit. He
assured me with many gestures he was praying
to God for help to be good and then he turned,
perhaps by habit, to the remark "Me no friends,
me poor man," adding somewhat to my dismay
he was soon coming home. Mentally I said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
"And what shall we do when you come," but
though I foresaw difficulties, I also felt that it
was to just such that Hope Hall could perhaps
prove a veritable haven of refuge. I assured
him again that we were his friends and I told
him to come straight to me on his discharge.</p>

<p>Some months passed, our Greek learned still
more of our language and to him the long,
looked-for day of liberty was very slow in coming,
while to us in our busy life of work, it was
a surprise when one day we entered our office to
find him sitting there dressed in his new suit and
beaming with smiles. As I had had all the interviews
with him in prison and I foresaw this
one would be somewhat lengthy, I turned him
over to my secretary after a few words of greeting
and commenced my morning mail opening.
Sometime after she came in to report, and I saw
that her eyes were full of tears. The story certainly
had its pathetic side, though parts of it
made our hearts beat quick with indignation.</p>

<p>He had been discharged from prison two days
before, and had received ninety-seven dollars
which represented his earnings for over-time
(then allowed in this state) and the money he
had deposited with the warden on entering the
prison. Realizing his deficiency in speech, he
had provided himself with plenty of matter to
prove his connection with the Volunteers. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
one pocket was his Day Book more treasured
than comprehended; in another the latest <i>Volunteer
Gazette</i> and in yet another his certificate
of membership in the League, which made a very
formidable roll. Besides these possessions he
proudly wore on his new suit the little white
button with its blue star and motto. Arriving at
the Grand Central Depot which was but fifteen
minutes' walk from my office in an absolutely
straight line, he was faced by the strange, bewildering
rush of the great city, and realized in
an overwhelming manner his foreignness to all
around him. He could not ask his way of any
member of that jostling crowd, and was not sure
enough of his powers of expression to venture
on any hurried inquiry. He therefore sought
out a police officer, imagining that that official
was there to protect and advise bewildered
strangers. Then he commenced his explanations.
Unrolling his V. P. L. certificate which
had upon it among other things a letter from my
pen and a small photograph he explained, pointing
to the picture, "Me want go Mrs. Booth.
Me belong Mrs. Booth." The word, "Volunteers"
upon the certificate was large enough to
be clearly read and my picture had been more
frequently than I had wished in the daily papers
for over twelve years, but neither of these things
seemed to enlighten the officer of the law, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
only shook his head and then, to get rid of the
man, directed him to quite another part of the
city. Each time he realized himself astray he
would repeat his request to some officer and
point to my picture, but none seemed ever to
have heard of me, or was it that it seemed sport
to play with this poor simple soul with the queer
broken speech and prison-made clothing? Any
way when I heard the story I felt tempted to
send my picture to be placed in company with
those of my "boys" in the Rogues' Gallery, that
it might be studied by the officers of the law so
that they might know where to direct those who
so sorely needed my help and protection.</p>

<p>When night at last closed in on the city, he
found himself in a down-town section where a
policeman impressed upon him that it would be
too late to find me, and directed him to a low
saloon above which he might lodge for the night.
Naturally, when he entered, he was recognized at
once as a simple foreigner and moreover as one
newly from prison. It is known that men from
prison have some little money with them, so he
was at once offered drinks. Though he was in
many things ignorant he had gained one or two
firm ideas as a League member and to these he
would adhere stubbornly. He promptly refused
to drink saying with a finger on the little white
badge, "Me no drink. Me belong Mrs. Booth!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Had he been able to express himself clearly, and
had his poor ignorant mind fully grasped the
teachings of our League, the higher motive and
loyalty to the Great Captain of our salvation
would have been his strength, but what he was
has to be remembered and to him a human
friend, meant hope and escape from despair and
forlornness. Finding that he would not drink at
the bar they escorted him to the room he was to
share with three other men. They were drinking
and card playing, and there again he was
offered drink and a cigar. He reiterated the
positive declaration which formed his few words
of explanation, "Me no drink! me no smoke.
Me belong Mrs. Booth!" and I fancy the denizens
of the saloon were better informed than
the police as to what lay behind the words.
Well for him he resisted that drink, for had he
taken it there was little chance of his waking to
find his money safe. Realizing the danger of
robbery, he sat up all night that he might not fall
asleep. In the morning he had gained a little
worldly wisdom and, as he asked, slipped a silver
piece in the policeman's hands and lo! in a few
minutes he was at our office door, for that officer
knew just where to find us. When we talked
with him later before sending him to Hope Hall,
he handed all his money over to me to bank and
as he counted it out the bills were all ones, ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
ones, whether fives, tens or twenties, and I had to
explain their value.</p>

<p>Before sending a man to the Home, we generally
inquire what his occupation has been, if he
has had any in the fields of labor, and also what
he did in prison, so as to be able to suggest the
best department of work for him at the Home,
and to know what kind of place to secure for
him on graduation. When this question was
put to our Greek, it seemed to mystify him. We
tried to make it as clear as possible and at last as
we repeated slowly, "What did you do in
prison?" a light of full comprehension broke
over his face. "Oh! me wheel shoes," he answered.
I thought he meant "heeled" shoes
but at that suggestion he shook his head most
decidedly. It was my turn to be mystified, for I
had never heard of "wheeling shoes" as a part
of the shoemaking industry. Further careful
inquiry revealed the fact that his labor had been
the wheeling of the barrow, in which shoes were
taken from the workshop to the storehouse, probably
the only duty for which they found him well
adapted. At Hope Hall we set him to weeding
the garden and a very happy inmate of the
Home was our poor friendless Greek. When he
graduated, it was to start in business for himself
at a bootblack stand which we purchased for
him with the money he had laid by. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
made a success of his work and has for years occupied
a very good corner in the heart of the
business portion of New York City. An ever-ready
smile greets the officer whom he knew in
the Home when he chances to pass that way, and
he enjoys the cleaning of shoes much more than
the "wheeling" industry.</p>

<p>It is not hard to picture what the end of this
story would have been, had there been no V. P.
L. and no Hope Hall. Coming a stranger to
New York, he might easily have been robbed
that first night. When men are robbed, especially
ignorant foreigners, who do not know how
to appeal to the law, they generally resent it and
show their resentment by fighting. Men who
are found fighting are arrested. On his arrest
he would have been detected as a newly returned
prisoner, and the witnesses against him could
easily have proved his violent and murderous attack.
He would have been sent off again to
prison with an extra long term because his offense,
committed so soon after release, would
have proved to some minds that he was an incorrigible
criminal. Once more in a prison cell
with heart growing bitter and mind enraged, he
would have murmured, "Me poor man, me no
friends."</p>

<p>I had been presenting the cause of our "boys"
in prison at a drawing-room gathering in a company
of the wealthy and fortunate, whose lives
were very remote from need, suffering and hunger.
I passed over the main branch of our work,
to one that has grown out of it, and told of the
dark, sad shadow that has fallen on many homes,
bringing untold suffering to the helpless and innocent.
After the meeting was over, a lady
made her way to my side and clasping my hand
she said very fervently, "I do thank you specially
for one thought you have given me this evening.
I have seen the outside of state prisons and have
always regarded them as places full of evil-doers
who justly deserve what they are suffering, and
there with me the whole question has ended. I
never for one moment realized that these men
had wives and mothers and little children. Of
course, if I had stopped to think, I would have
seen that side of it, but I never gave the question
a thought." I believe there are very many who,
if they confessed the truth, would have to admit
the same thing. This perhaps saddest side of
the question hidden away in aching hearts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
shadowed homes does not flaunt itself in the
press, does not beg on our streets nor appeal to
us through Christian publications as do the needs
that can be classified. Yet the need is there and
it is very real and urgent. If there are eighty-four
thousand men to-day in our prisons, think
what a vast number of sorrowing hearts must be
bearing their suffering and shame in the outside
world!</p>

<p>I think my work has become doubly dear and
sacred to me since I have realized that I could
go to these "boys" as a messenger and representative
of their mothers. Very grateful have
I been for the name "Little Mother" which they
have given me, for I feel that I go not to impress
my own personality upon them, but to revive in
them the sacred memories of the past and if possible,
to help in bringing the answer to the many
mothers' prayers that for so long have seemed
fruitless of result.</p>

<p>I once received a letter from one of the men
in which he said, "Little Mother, as you talked
to us on Sunday in the chapel it was not your
voice I heard, but it seemed to me my mother
spoke again from the long ago, and it was not
your face I saw, but her face that came up before
me as I had seen it in the days of my childhood:"
This thought has meant a great deal to me and
having come to feel how true this is of my ministry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
to many of the prisoners, I have found I
could take to them a double message, first from
their God and then from some loved one, the
very mention of whom aroused all their better
nature and awakened purer thoughts within their
minds.</p>

<p>I always believed that mother-love was next
to Divine love, the most beautiful and unselfish
of all affections, but the belief has been intensified
since I have learned to know the many sorrowing
mothers of our "boys" in prison, who
despite all they have suffered; shame, disappointment
and wrong, have loved on and stood
faithfully by their erring ones. I believe such
mothers are the great hope and very sheet anchor
to men who can never quite forget them,
however far they may go astray and disregard
their prayers and wishes.</p>

<p>Just as we find within prison walls men of
every class, so the homes on which the blow has
fallen are widely different, and the needs represented
are often in great contrast. One mother
surrounded by wealth in a home of ease and
comfort may not need material help, but craves
that which comes from true heart sympathy.
Another may, in her old age, be left utterly destitute
and have to face sickness and want, yet
with both, the boy in prison is the first thought,
and any one who can help him is welcome as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
their friend. No work especially organized to
help the mothers and families of men in prison
and commencing with them, could be successful.
They are not to be found by inquiries from tenement
to tenement; they certainly would not be
attracted by an announcement over an office
building proclaiming it as a bureau for their special
assistance. They have their pride and self-respect
and rather than go and seek help or pour
out the story of their woes and wrongs to strangers,
they would hide away and bear their burden
alone.</p>

<p>From the very commencement of our prison
work I realized that it must be a movement of
natural growth, that each want as it was found
must be met by the method that developed to
meet it. As the men grew to know and trust
us, they began to tell us of the dear ones at home.
Many a time a young man in prison under an
alias would confide his real name, and give us the
duty of breaking gently to his dear ones the
knowledge of his whereabouts. With others
there was the feeling that long silence spoke of
unforgiveness at home, and it was for us to try and
bring about a reconciliation. Very often the
distress and suffering of his family has caused a
man worry almost to the point of madness and
a letter has been hurriedly written asking us to
go post-haste and render the needed help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, as the men became interested
in the League and the new experience deepened
in their hearts, they wrote the good news to
their homes, sometimes away over the seas, and
back from every part of this country, and from
very many distant lands came to us loving, grateful
letters from mothers who felt they could pour
out to us the heart-longings and anxiety that had
been so long borne in solitude. The tie of
friendship and understanding is much stronger
and draws hearts together much more surely than
that of charitable bounty. We can do far more
in every way for these women for the reason that
we are introduced to them by sons or husbands.
My dear friend and helper, Mrs. McAlpin, has
especially taken this work on her heart, so far as
the prisons of this state are concerned, and
through her talks with the men, she has been enabled
to put us in touch with numbers of families
who in this great city were in dire need of a
helping hand. From the western prisons the
work comes to us mostly through the mail, and
we find that this new and unexpected field of
usefulness has developed so rapidly that we have
had to appoint one worker to do nothing else
but visit the families thus referred to us. Before
I write some of the stories of those materially
helped, I want to speak of the mothers who
have been cheered and comforted by good messages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
of their boys returning to the right path
within prison walls.</p>

<p>At the first meeting ever held in Sing Sing a
little company of men took their stand for the
new life, and among them was a tall, fine-looking
young fellow whose deep emotion and evident sincerity
very much impressed me. He stood with
his face sternly set, showing in its pallor the effort
that it cost him to rise before that great crowd
of fellow-prisoners, and yet, determination was
written in every feature. As I watched him, I
saw the tears course their way down his cheeks.
It was such a striking and earnest face that the
chaplain also especially noticed him and found
out his name for me. Shortly afterwards my mail
contained a letter which brought me into closer
touch with him, and then my interviews from
time to time gave me his history link by link,
until I knew the whole. It is one that has undoubtedly
a thousand counterparts. He was the
only black sheep of a bright, happy family, the
youngest son and his mother's darling. Associating
with wild companions, he went astray,
saddening and bringing constant trouble to his
home. His mother and sisters clung to him,
pleaded and wept in vain. He went on in his
wild course until he got into trouble in his home
state, from the consequence of which his people
saved him. Then he broke away entirely from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
home restraints and came east. By this time
drink had gained a strong hold on him and he
mixed in his drinking sprees with the roughest
crowds. One night he was arrested in a saloon
with a gang that had committed a burglary, and
soon after found himself in state prison with a
long term of years to serve. In that lonely cell
a picture hung over his cot that carried his mind
away over the country to the sunny Californian
village where she, whose face smiled down upon
him, prayed still for her boy, knowing nothing
of this last disgrace. After enduring silence for
some time, his longing for letters from home compelled
him to write, but he hid the fact of his imprisonment,
giving the prison number of the
street as the place where he was working. It
happened however that a friend left their home
village to visit in New York state, and he was
commissioned by the mother to see her boy.
Inquiring for the street and number in Sing
Sing, he found the prison, so that sad news
winged its way to the distant home. Through
this trial the mother's love stood firm, and the most
tender, helpful letters came month after month
to the little cell where time passed all too drearily.
When this boy took his stand for God and became
a Christian, he wrote the news home, and
very shortly I received a long, loving letter from
his mother. She rejoiced in the change that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
come to her boy and then asked all about his
prison life and surroundings, begging me to
watch over him and to be to him as far as possible
what she would be, if she were near enough to
visit him. For two years we corresponded, and
I had much good news to tell her of the boy's
earnest, faithful life. Once we met and I shall
never forget that mother's face and words. I
had been having a heavy programme of engagements
in San Francisco and was resting between
the meetings. The news came that two ladies
wanted to speak to me, and I sent my secretary
to explain that I was very weary and had to rest.
She came back in a few moments to tell me their
names, and at once I went to them, realizing that
it was the mother and sister of that "boy" in
Sing Sing. When I entered the room I found
a truly beautiful young girl with a sweet, refined
face, and a dear old lady dressed in widow's weeds.
As she rose to greet me, the words died on her
lips and she could only sob, "Oh, you've seen
my boy, my boy!" When she was calmer she
told me she had come forty miles that day to
meet me. She had been ill in bed and her daughters
tried to dissuade her from the effort, but she
said, "I could not stay away; I think it would
have killed me to miss this chance of seeing one
who had seen my boy." Then she began to talk
of him in the tender intimate way only a mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
can talk. She asked me many questions that were
difficult to answer: just how he looked, what
they gave him to eat, what his cell was like,
what work he had to do, etc. When we parted,
she put her hands on my shoulders and kissed
me saying, "Oh, you have lifted such a heavy,
heavy burden from my heart," while the sister
added, "There was an empty place in our home
we never expected to have filled again, but you
have brought us the assurance that our boy will
soon be there with us again." As I turned back
again to my work, I said to myself, "It is all worth
while, if only to bring the grain of comfort to
such loyal, loving hearts."</p>

<p>On his discharge from prison the "boy" came
to us, waited at Hope Hall until I could get his
ticket, and then went back to the home from
which I received the brightest news of their
happy reunion. During the late war, he served
under Dewey at Manila and I have a letter written
just before he entered into action, a letter full
of earnest Christian joy and courage.</p>

<p>Many a time, as I travel, I meet mothers whom
I have not known through correspondence, but
who seek me out to tell the glad news of homes
to which a real change has come with the dear
ones' restoration, with a new purpose in life and
the strength to fulfill it.</p>

<p>Here is a letter lately received from a village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
in Germany:&mdash;"Dear Mrs. Booth:&mdash;Since a long
time I had the intention to write to you and to
express you my deepest thank and veneration
for the Christian love and care you have for my
poor son Hans, which is fallen so deep. You
may imagine what a relief it is for my heart to
hear that in foreign land is found a soul who take
such interest at heart for my poor son, to guide
him again to Christian love. For me it is unfortunately
quite impossible to do anything for
him, only I pray for him to the Lord, who never
wills the death of sinner and who alone can reform
him truly. I beg, dear Mrs. Booth, help
him as much as you can for the Saviour. All
you have done and your exhortations have quite
won his heart and he is full of trust and confidence
in you. You may believe with what
grief and sorrow I ever think of my son. He
once got such a good education, and was trained
with care and love in a positive Christian home.
May God you assist in your blessed undertaking
that Hans may turn over a new leaf and be again
a useful and smart fellow. I am so very sorry
that I can do nothing at all than lay all my cares
and troubles in your hand and assure you that I
feel exceeding thankful. You will oblige me
very much if you will be so kind to give me
once a little note upon my son and please excuse
my bad English. I hope you will understand it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
but I have no exercise at all in writing. I hope
this lines will come to your hands and with
kindest regards, I am, Yours truly."</p>

<p>As I lay down the letter, I have a vision of a
dear soul with her dictionary at her side laboriously
putting these thoughts on paper and I
imagine the longing and yearning with which
her mother heart goes out over the seas to her
boy in prison, beyond her reach, but not beyond
her love.</p>

<p>Often the letters have come written in German,
French or Italian, but in all the same story
"watch over my boy, give me tidings of him."
Once or twice the letters have been from those
in high social position, and often the poorly written
efforts of a very humble folk, but the message
is always the same. Love and forgiveness,
yearning through the shame and sorrow. Several
times we have had the joy of sending the
boy back to his far away home, and getting good
news from him when he is again under the safest,
strongest influences on earth.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most pathetic letter from over
seas came to me from a mother in Australia. I
had had the duty of breaking to her the news of
her son's imprisonment, and afterwards forwarding
his letters to her each month and receiving
hers for him. She was an earnest Christian and
though quite old and feeble, wrote him very long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
and loving letters by every mail and prayed
without ceasing that she might see his face once
more before she died. At last a letter reached
me that told me of a very dangerous seizure; the
doctor had informed her that she had perhaps
but a few hours to live and at most could not
last many days. The writing was very shaky
and in many places almost illegible, while gaps
here and there told where the pencil had dropped
from the fingers that were already growing cold
in death. She had had to rest often to gain
strength to finish it. Her letter is too sacred for
reproduction. In it she poured out to me her
anguish and heart's longing for her boy. She
told me his weak points, and begged me to stand
by him. She asked me to break the news of her
death and to pass on her last message. The last
few lines were literally written in the anguish of
death, and she closed with the words "if you get
no news by the next mail you can tell my boy
his mother is gone." The next mail brought a
letter but it was black edged and from another
member of the family, telling me that she had
died with his name on her lips.</p>

<p>Such instances as this add much to the sacredness
of our work and to our intense desire for its
lasting results where so much is often at stake.
I remember one young man in Sing Sing whose
earnest efforts to do right made him a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
marked and successful member of our League.
He was among the first to enroll and when I
talked with him personally I found him very
happy in his new found experience. He told
me frankly that his past had been a wretchedly
unworthy one; and it was not his first imprisonment.
Drink had been the cause of his downfall
every time, as it is with most of the "boys,"
and he had over and over again broken the law
when under its influence. "But," he said, "that
is not my worst sin; what I feel most now, is the
wrong I have done my poor old mother. I have
well nigh broken her heart, and over and over
again brought her sorrow and disgrace, but she
has loved me through it all. She won't believe I
am half as bad as I really am." With tears and
the deepest emotion, he told me how he would
with God's help make up to her what she had
suffered. Sometime later the mother called on
me. She came to tell me of her joy over her
son's letters. He had told her that at last her
God had become his God and that her prayers
were answered. No pen could paint a word
picture of that mother's face. Transfigured with
the divine love she felt for her wandering boy,
as she told me of all his good points and tried to
make me see as she did how well worth saving
he was. Behind the love there were so many
lines of pain and anxiety, that coupled with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
story, I could realize something of the tragedy,
but the tears that fell so thick and fast were of
the quality that would make them precious in
heaven, and they surely would not pass unremembered
by the One who fully knows and
understands all the suffering of which the human
heart is capable.</p>

<p>On a Good Friday, I saw him in prison for the
last time. Very cheerily he greeted me with the
news of his approaching release and promised he
would come to our office the first hour of his
arrival in New York. On my engagement list I
entered the initials of his name, that when the
day came, we might watch for his arrival. The
morning hours passed; we thought some slight
delay had arisen. The afternoon went by, still
he did not come. Very reluctantly we closed
our desks and went home. The next day we
waited and watched and still no news. I suppose
if I had had any "Job's comforters," on my
little staff, they would have suggested to me that
the first saloon had proved too much for him,
and that our returning wanderer had most likely
drowned all his good resolves in the same stuff
that had been his undoing in the past. Fortunately
we were all of us workers on the sunny
side of the street and evil shadows were not
hunted up to cloud our confidence. We felt
sure all was well, and the mail four days later told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the story. He explained how sorry he was not
to report at headquarters, but on reaching New
York his brother had met him with the news of
the mother's illness and he hurried at once to her
side. The next day he had found work and
he added, "Now, Little Mother, I fear I shall not
be able to see you, for I must work every day for
my mother's sake, for you know what I have
promised. I want to build up a home for her
and make up for the sorrow I have caused her
in the past." Some days later the mother came
herself to tell me of her boy's home-coming, and
the tears that fell now were tears of joy. The
most pathetic part of the story to me was this;
she said that, as the time grew near for his home-coming,
the old dread crept into her heart. She
had so often watched for him, not knowing in
what condition he might return, or whether he
would come at all, that the habit of fear triumphed
over her faith, and though his letters had been so
different and his promises seemed so earnest, her
heart misgave her. She said, "What do you
think my boy did? The very first thing he went
to the telegraph office and sent me this message,
'Don't worry, mother, I am coming.'"&mdash;Ah, God
grant that we may help to flash that message to
the hundreds of sorrowing mothers whose hearts
turn anxiously to those opening prison doors!
Are not all the efforts, all the toils, all the dollars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
expended well worth while to bring back brightness
and comfort to these hearts, that for so long
have sat in the gloom of the most tragic bereavement?
As the months passed, good news came
to me of this happy family. The young man
joined the church in the village where his mother
had long been a respected Christian. He became
attached to temperance work, and by his warnings
many other young men were induced to
take the pledge. He and his brother went into
business; they prospered, and at last they fulfilled
his ambition, building with their own hands
the home that they had promised to their dear
old mother.</p>

<p>These are stories of mothers; what of the wives
and little children? It seems hopeless to give any
adequate idea of that sad side of the picture. In
many cases the imprisonment of the man means
absolute want and suffering to the innocent
family. I remember a very strong letter I received
from one of the "boys," in which he said,
"I cannot tell you, Little Mother, how bitterly I
reproach myself for the suffering I have brought
upon my wife and little children. My lot is easy
to theirs. They are the real sufferers for my
wrong-doing. I have shelter and clothing, with
three meals a day provided by the state, while
they have to face want and perhaps absolute
starvation. No words can describe the anguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
I suffer on their behalf." This is only too true.
The state takes away the mainstay of the family
and for them there is suffering worse than his to
be faced. I do not blame the state; I am not so
irrational as to plead that for their sake he must
be given his liberty, but I do say that some hand
must be stretched out to help them, and that here
is a great field where there is no fear of misspent
charity.</p>

<p>Many of these women have not been accustomed
to work for a living, and when left to
their own resources they have no trade or any
means of livelihood, while such work as washing
or scrubbing often proves far too heavy for their
strength. They are not the kind of women who
can beg. They dread making an appeal to public
charity, because they would have to tell of the
husband's whereabouts and of his crime, and in
their loyal hearts they long to shield him, so
alone they battle on, trying to keep the wolf from
the door and to hold the little family together,
until they almost drop with exhaustion or are
driven to desperation, when faced with temptations
that are worse than death itself.</p>

<p>I remember a letter I received one day from
Sing Sing with a special delivery stamp announcing
its urgency. The man was at that time a
stranger to me, but he turned to us in this darkest
moment of despair. The letter was written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
as the gray light of dawn crept into his cell. It
told how all night long he had walked back and
forth and how in his anguish and helplessness,
he felt as if his brain would give way. He had
a young wife and baby; she had had a hard
unequal struggle, and was not a woman of strong
nature or any skill as a worker. At last he received
a letter in which she said she could stand
the struggle no longer. She was at the end of
her resources; she and her child could not starve.
Anyway, an easy though evil way, was open
and she was going to take it. "For God's sake,"
he wrote, "go and find her and save her from
what would be worse than death." Before many
hours were passed we had her in our care. She
was sent to a position and her little one watched
over and the good news flashed back to that
anxious heart behind the bars.</p>

<p>Another man who was serving five years in
prison, wrote to us to say that he had heard his wife
and five children were in dire need. I copy the
report of the case as it stands on our books from
the pen of our representative who investigated
and afterwards watched over the family: "We
took hold of this case about two years before
expiration of sentence. Eldest child, a girl, was
eleven years of age; next a boy of nine; all the
rest were little ones. Baby was born three days
after father went to prison. Mother worked from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
five in the morning until dark in the summer,
picking peas and other such work for sixty cents
a day. I have waited until eight o'clock at night
for her to come home. Children were all locked
out in the street for fear they would burn the house
down. They spent their time making mud-pies
in a lot. The neighbors used to help them
sometimes, but they were poor themselves. They
reported that the children often came at night
under their windows and cried for bread when
they were starving. When first found, they were
half naked and very hungry. When fed, which
had to be done at once with what could be
purchased at a near-by store, they fell on the
food like little wild beasts, literally tearing it in
their hunger." For two years we helped them
with clothing, food and in many ways. Then
the father came home, found work and has
written us very grateful, happy letters.</p>

<p>Here is another story: The husband was an
almost prosperous man, keeping a county hotel
and having an interest in a factory. He was
murderously attacked by a man whom he afterwards
shot, as he thought, in self-defense. Had
he shot the man on his own property, he would
have been guiltless in the eyes of the law, but as
he shot him after he had forced him from the
gate, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
For four years his wife fought bravely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
with starvation. When we found her, the three
children were down with scarlet fever; they had
previously had measles. The mother worked at
the hardest kind of labor for a living, and was
herself sick, first with malaria and then with
hemorrhages of the lungs and was often found
in a fainting condition. We took this family on
our list, and Mrs. McAlpin also helped them
generously. Had they not been tided over the
hard places during sickness, severe cold and in
other emergencies, this family must have gone
under in the unequal struggle. On his return
from prison, the father found work and was enabled
to provide them with a home. Now they
are comfortably off, and the mother with proper
care is regaining her health.</p>

<p>A German who had held splendid positions
before his incarceration, wrote us in great distress
about his wife and children. She had with
indomitable courage maintained herself and the
little ones, but at the time of writing, he informed
us, he had just received news that the children were
down with diphtheria and that she was quarantined
with them, which meant of course, that she
was unable to work, hence the necessary money
for rent and food would not be forthcoming. We
sent at once to investigate, paid the rent and
sent in a supply of groceries, with some of the
nourishing food which the sick children so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
needed. From that time we kept them under
observation, until the father's return made them
independent.</p>

<p>Another letter sent from prison led us to hunt
up a family where we found the woman helpless
with a new-born babe, and she had besides a
boy of seven and a girl of three and had just
buried her eldest child, a girl of nine years.
They had gone behind in rent and as she was in
no condition to work, we sent her with her two
little girls to our Home. The boy was placed in
a school where he is having a good education
and every care. We have watched over and
provided for the family ever since, and hope
shortly to get the father paroled so that he may
again make a home for them.</p>

<p>I found the following report of a case on my
desk the other day: "Husband ... has
five years' sentence only just commenced. Wife
is a young woman, has a boy four years of age
and very shortly expects another little one. She
has lived with her newly-married sister, a mere
girl, whose husband is now out of work. Wife
has been sick lately, and is very delicate. Rent
due and liable to be dispossessed any time. Has
had nothing to eat to-day. Borrowed a little
coffee from a neighbor. We gave her two dollars
to meet immediate need. Woman was very
grateful, said that two dollars was just as if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
had fifty, she was so glad of it. This is a worthy
case. The woman was clean and neat, though
both she and the child have practically no clothing.
Clothes should be furnished immediately from
our storeroom. These are really brave people."</p>

<p>Entering my office one day I found a very
young girl waiting to see me. She was clad in a
cotton gown, though it was bitter winter weather.
She seemed to be numbed, not only with the
cold, but with the awful lethargy of despair. On
her lap lay what looked like an old blanket, but
as she talked, the blanket fell back and disclosed
the naked body of a tiny babe not three weeks
old. It was blue with cold and cried in the weak,
gasping way that speaks of starvation. "Yes, I
suppose it is hungry," said the child mother,
"but so am I; I have had nothing to eat for
twenty-four hours." The father was in prison
and her people had turned her out because they
could not be burdened with the unwelcome little
one.</p>

<p>Another young mother came to see me, but
she was of quite another type. Not the helpless
apathetic girl, whom sorrow robs of feeling, but
a woman young, strong and beautiful, but maddened
by despair. As she pressed her tiny babe
to her heart she said, "What am I to do? We
must live. I cannot see my baby starve and yet
I can't get work, for nobody wants me with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
babe at my breast. It is a hard, hard path in
this great city for the woman who wants to keep
good and do right, but it seems, for the one who
goes wrong and does evil, that there is plenty of
good food, fine clothes, warmth and shelter. I
don't want to do that, I can't sell my soul, so I
was on my way to the river, which seemed the
best place for baby and me."</p>

<p>In just such cases as these the friend in the
hour of need can save the misstep and point out
the better, safer way to the weary, stumbling feet.
We have two Children's Homes, to which not
only children, but mothers can be sent, to tide
them over until strong enough to work and get
a little home together.</p>

<p>Here is another case of a woman who made a
brave struggle to keep herself and her three children
alive. She worked early and late and for a
long while kept her home together. Sickness
came and then starvation stared her in the face.
A delicate, refined woman, she could not beg;
she was finally discovered almost too late,
seemingly sick unto death. Carefully and tenderly
she was nursed back to health. One child
died and was buried. Thank God, not in Potter's
Field, but where the mother could see where
her darling lay. As she recovered from the delirium
of sickness, she asked of what the baby
died. "Tell her that it was sick," the doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
said, "its little heart stopped, but never let her
know that her child starved to death." And she
never did. The father is home by now, and
works hard every day. The door is shut upon
the sad past. They are happy children and
thankful parents.</p>

<p>We try to keep a fund to meet the needs of
these families; a little help in meeting the rent,
providing suitable clothing for the children who
attend school, money for medicine or nourishing
foods when there is sickness, may just tide them
over and prevent great misery, without in any
sense robbing them of their self-respect or making
them dependent upon charity.</p>

<p>These stories give you only a glimpse of the
wide field. They could be multiplied by the
score, aye by the hundred, but even then the
much that lies beneath and behind the work,
must be seen and felt to be understood.</p>

SANTA CLAUS RESURRECTED</a></h2>


<p>Christmas is a sad season in prison, because it
is, perhaps of all days, the one when thoughts
most surely circle around home and when pictures
of past happy days shine out in vivid contrast
to the lonely narrow cell with its bare walls
and heavy barred door. But if it is a sad day
for the men within the walls it is equally so for
many of the families who have to abandon the
thought of any Christmas cheer to brighten their
poverty.</p>

<p>Naturally fathers in prison, whose little ones
are still intensely dear to them, grieve much over
their inability to do anything towards the cheering
and gladdening of the children's Christmas.
We have for several years now made our Christmas
greeting to the families of our "boys" a
special feature of our work. We have a big
book in which a list of our families is carefully
recorded, every child's sex and age, and, as far as
possible, size, can be found therein. Besides this
we send to the New York and New Jersey prisons
some weeks before the holidays, and ask all
men who know that their dear ones are in poverty,
to send us the home address that we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
visit them, and in this way compile a very complete
list of those who need help. Naturally this
has proved a great cheer to the men themselves,
and in many instances has touched hearts that
were hardened against any religious influence.
Kindness breaks down barriers that preachment
or argument would only cause to close the
tighter.</p>

<p>A man who had been quite indifferent as to
himself and full of ridicule and abuse towards
members of our prison league, was talking to
some fellow-prisoners about the dire poverty of
his family, distressing news of which had just
reached him through the mail. A League member
overhearing, said, "Why don't you write and
tell the Little Mother?" "Much notice she
would take of it," he answered. "Why, I am
not a member of the League&mdash;she don't know
me&mdash;I would get no answer to my letter." The
V. P. L. boy persisted and at last the other said,
"Well I'll test it, but I don't expect anything."
Sometime afterwards he received a very happy
letter from his wife telling of the big parcel of
things received, food, clothing and toys for the
children. He was deeply touched, and acknowledging
this to the boy who had advised him, he
added, "Look here&mdash;it's time I made a man of
myself. I've neglected my family and made
them suffer, and here are strangers who think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
enough of them to help them. It's time I did
the same." He joined the League and became a
most earnest member, getting ready to be the
kind of man who could on his return make a
happy home, where in the past he had only
brought sorrow and misery.</p>

<p>Our preparations for Christmas have to begin
several weeks beforehand. Our idea has never
been to prepare a big banquet to which the hungry
are bidden for one good meal. Many of our
families are out of town or scattered from one
end to the other of this long island, and even
could we gather them all together, we want our
help to be more lasting. The Christmas tree
decked for the children is a treat always enjoyed
by little ones, but even that sends them back to
a very gloomy home that seems all the colder
with its fireless stove and empty cupboard, after
the glitter and brightness of the festivity. Our
idea is to make the home, poor though it may
be, the centre of rejoicing. By visiting beforehand
and by our close knowledge of the circumstances,
we can tell just the needs of each family
and can prepare accordingly. Our plan is to
give to each child one good suit of clothing,&mdash;to
provide a supply of groceries, a turkey and
money sufficient for fuel and vegetables. Some
needed article of clothing for the mother is added
and then toys and candies for the children. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
could hardly send the mothers instructions to
hang up the stockings for us to fill, for sometimes
the nuts, candy and oranges, would drop
through these much-worn articles, and often there
would be no stockings to hang up. We therefore
buy stockings wholesale and fill them at our
office. Not only do we attach its mate to each
filled stocking, but we add another pair so that
every child may have a change. I could not
speak of the need of the Christmas season without
speaking also of the way our friends have
helped us to meet it. The girls of Vassar and
Smith Colleges have year after year dressed dolls
and collected toys for us. Many of the children in
happy homes have done likewise, as also in some
of the private schools. Boxes containing these
gifts commence arriving in the weeks before Christmas
and each new supply is received with acclamation
by the little staff of workers who know
the joy that it will bring to the hearts of our
Christmasless little ones. The chapter of "King's
Daughters and Sons of Hartford, Connecticut"&mdash;organized
three years ago to help my work,
is especially generous in its Christmas effort.
Barrels of clothing and toys can always be relied
on to come from that source, and so much personal
work and careful thought is expended on
the gifts that they seem doubly valuable.</p>

<p>We raise a Christmas fund by newspaper appeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
and from our regular donors, and then follow
our shopping trips armed with a list of the ages
and sizes of my many boys and girls and babies.
I descend on the stores to amaze the salesgirls
with the size of my family, which proves a mystery
until they find out who I am. Trousers for
ninety or a hundred boys, dresses for an equal
number of little girls&mdash;sweaters by the score and
baby outfits by the dozen, are soon chosen, and
our storeroom at headquarters becomes almost
like a department store. We spend about a hundred
dollars for shoes of various sizes and always
lay in a large supply of toboggan caps, which are
a special delight to the boys.</p>

<p>The work of packing is not easy, where the
special garments and toys must always be assigned
to needs and ages. When the parcels
for distant families are ready, they are shipped
by express, but all within reach are given out
personally. Our Hope Hall wagon goes from
home to home the whole day before Christmas.</p>

<p>The poverty revealed is pitiful in the extreme
and the gratitude of mothers who receive this
Christmas cheer is pathetic in its intensity. To
many of the little ones it has been explained that
no Santa Claus can come to their home because
father is away, so the surprise is all the greater.
One family we heard of through the letter of the
eldest child, a ten year old boy, in which he told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
us that their "Santa Claus was dead." He had
a baby brother thirteen months old, another aged
six years and three little sisters. The child
added, "Mother goes out working but she can't
get us anything." You can imagine the joy
that the Christmas gifts caused, when we resurrected
Santa Claus in that top floor tenement.</p>

<p>Last Christmas, in all the homes visited, not one
could boast of fire or fuel. It would have been
mockery to give out the turkeys and chickens
without also giving the wherewithal to cook them.</p>

<p>In one home just under the shadow of the
Brooklyn Bridge was found a mother and her
three little girls. They had nothing to eat in
the cupboard and no fire to drive the damp chill
from the two rooms they called home. Everything
however was neat and clean. The woman
was found weak from sickness and starvation.
She had just buried a two days' old baby. When
the gifts were displayed, she was too overcome
to speak but her tears showed how strong was
her feeling. The children were wild with delight
but when the eldest commenced to tell
something, the mother tried to hush her; urged
to go on, she said&mdash;"This morning we had just
three cents left&mdash;we went out and got tea with it
and made it good and strong for we could have
nothing to eat." This is the mother's letter received
a day or two afterwards&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am very thankful to you for your kindness
to my children and myself. It was a big surprise
to us, as it is three weeks since we had a
good substantial meal. I have given birth to a
girl baby and buried her a day after she was
born. I was laid up two weeks and not able to
work, nor could I provide the necessary things
for her burial, but the children of the neighborhood
made up a collection for it. You can see
what a hard struggle I have had to fight. If you
could possibly get me some sewing to do, so as
to make my rent, it would be a relief to my
heart."</p>

<p>One Christmas, when I was able to do the
work of distribution personally, I entered a home
on the fifth floor of a big tenement. There was
a small living room and kitchen combined and a
windowless bedroom not much more than a cupboard
in size. A mother and five children lived
there. There was no fire in the stove. The cupboard
door was off its hinges and it certainly was
not needed, for there was not even a loaf of bread
in the house. The only occupant of the room
when I entered, was a little girl of about eight
years. She sat at the table with her doll. It
had neither legs nor arms and, having lost its
wig, there was a terrible looking cavity in its
head. She was trying to cover its far from handsome
body with a piece of red flannel. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
glad to know that a beautifully dressed doll
would be hers when the Christmas parcels were
opened. The mother when visited a year before
had said to us in her broken English, "No happy
Christmas till he come home," pointing to the
picture on the wall of the father who was in
prison. Is it a wonder that her face looked
hopeless, and the tears fell fast when we asked
her how long that day would be in coming, and
she had to answer "Twenty years."</p>

<p>Late one Christmas eve, when the work of distribution
was nearly over, the officer who had
charge of that duty for the upper part of the city,
climbed up the many gloomy stairs of a great
tenement and knocked at the rear door. All
was dark and quiet, but when the knock was repeated
she heard a child-voice answer, "Wait a
minute, please." In a few moments the door
was opened, and in the light stood a lovely child.
She was about six years old and clad in her little
white night-dress, with the halo effect of her
golden curls, she looked like an angel. The
child seemed surprised to see a visitor but with
much natural courtesy she asked her in, placed a
chair for her, and then with an "excuse me,
please" she flitted into the inner room to slip on
her dress and shoes, explaining also that she
must "see to the children." The bedroom revealed
two other little ones&mdash;a boy of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
four and a baby of some sixteen months whom
the little girl tucked in again very tenderly after
dressing her brother, with the instruction "You
must keep covered up, baby dear." Then she
returned to talk to the visitor. Mother, it seemed,
was out trying to collect some money which was
owing her for work. Did she know about Santa
Claus? Oh! yes, she knew all about him, only
mother said he could not call at their house this
year. A look around, however, showed that he
was much needed. There was neither food nor
fuel in the house, but it was scrupulously clean
and the children's clothing, which was very
threadbare and much patched, showed that the
mother's loving fingers had done all that could
be done to keep them neat and clean. Waxing
confidential on the subject of Santa Claus, the
little girl added, "Johnny and I have been
listening and we thought we heard him whistling
down the chimney. Didn't we, Johnny?"
Johnny, round-eyed and wide awake by now
assented, and then the interest of both children
was riveted on the visitor by her startling announcement
that Santa Claus' wagon was down
below in the street. On being asked if she
would like a doll, if such a treasure could be
found in the wonderful wagon, her little face
lighted up with joy and she cried impetuously,
"Oh, yes!" But immediately checking herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
she added, "No thank you, ma'am, I think I am
too old, but baby would like it, I am sure." Poor
tiny mother with the care of the children on her
shoulders, she had already learned to sacrifice,
and to realize how short a childhood is the lot of
the children of the poor. The scene can be
imagined better than described, when parcel after
parcel was piled up on the table and the children,
joined even by the baby, danced around in an
expectancy of delight. It was a happy Christmas
after all, and the father in his prison cell,
heard the echo of it afterwards. He has been
home now some time and the little family is prosperous
once more. They have now no fear that
Santa Claus will only "whistle down the chimney"
in passing as he whirls by to the more
fortunate ones to leave them hungry, cold and
forgotten.</p>

<p>Our representative who has for two years
taken the greatest interest in this work writes as
follows:</p>

<p>"This is the size of the baby's shoes. The
mother had put the baby's foot on a piece of
paper marking around it with a pencil and forwarded
it to Mrs. Booth with the above explanation.
The baby got the shoes. There is no way
however in which we can mark the size of the
hearts that went out in pity and compassion to
bring a happy Christmas into the homes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
hundreds of poor mothers and little children
where the man of the house was gone. Often
the little ones had said, 'Oh! mamma, where is
papa?' The mother with aching heart and
tearful eyes gave an evasive answer, for the father
was in prison. Whatever may have been the
guilt of the man behind the bars, there can be
no doubt about the misery and wretchedness of
these poor creatures, bereft of the bread winner.
The struggle to keep the gaunt wolf&mdash;poverty&mdash;from
the door was greatly enhanced last winter
by the scarcity of coal. In nearly all the houses
I visited in New York City the fire was out. In
some coal was only a memory&mdash;driftwood,
broken boxes and cinders from ash heaps having
been used. Some children doing nothing but
search from morning till night for anything that
could be made to burn.</p>

<p>"In one family the old grandfather, too old to
work, keeps the house, a boy of thirteen works in
a Broadway store and he is the sole support of
the family. Another brother of seven forages
for fuel all day, and the little sister of five goes to
school.</p>

<p>"On the upper east side, among other things we
gave a little girl not only a doll but a beautiful
little trunk full of clothes that had been sent with
it. Her brother of ten received a sled and they
both got new clothes. These two children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
simply went mad with joy. Running into a
back room, they stood and screamed aloud to
vent their feelings and the good woman, a hard
worker, said with tears in her eyes, 'My man
will be home this time next year.' For five
years she had fought the wolf alone. This
woman walked the streets of New York (being
evicted the very day her husband was sentenced)
all night long, with her two little children clinging
to her skirts. Finally she procured a room&mdash;a
wash tub and an old stove, and she and her
little ones lay upon the bare floor every night for
six weeks with nothing to cover them but the
mother's skirts.</p>

<p>"Christmas was made happy for another woman
and her two children. She works in a box factory
and in good times earns three dollars and a
half a week. The poor are kind to each other.
This woman said after we had given her her
gifts, 'I wish you could do something for the
woman in the cellar. She is worse off than I
am.' In the cellar we found a forlorn starving
creature with a baby and a boy of seven. The
husband was paralyzed in one arm. He made
only one dollar the week before. We attended
to the immediate wants of this family and since
then have sent clothing, for the woman and children
were practically naked. The help she received
was so unexpected that she walked up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
down the miserable foul cellar pressing her baby
to her breast, and saying over and over again
like one in a dream, 'I never expected it.'</p>

<p>"We turn into a side street and stop at a house&mdash;one
of the kind Dickens liked to describe. No
one lived on the ground floor&mdash;at least all was
dark, and the front door without a lock banged
upon its hinges. Rails upon the staircase were
partly gone and the cold wind rushed through
the hall. At the top of the stairs is a smoky oil
lamp with broken chimney. We knock at the
first door to the left and a young girl timidly
opens it. Two little children, five and seven respectively,
peer out suspiciously from behind
their sister, who is in this case mother of the
house. She is eighteen years old, and when we
explain our mission, the door swings wide open,
for food, coal, and clothing mean a happy Christmas.
The little ones set up an impromptu dance
and the girl stepping back, shades her eyes with
her hands. She is crying but it is because she is
glad. Each of the little ones has a doll by now
and one has crept off to the corner and is talking
to hers in mysterious doll language. They
do not worry any more about the visitor because
they are absorbed in their treasure. Finally we
get them interested in sundry little dresses that
the man from the wagon below is bringing, with
a turkey and other good things, until the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
mother of the house hardly knows what to say
but she says as we hand her a good sized bill,
'Oh! thank you sir.' I can never tell you all
that the 'thank you, sir!' expressed. So with
a merry Christmas we left them all overwhelmed
with joy.</p>

<p>"Near the top of a tenement on the west side I
find a mother and two little girls and a tiny baby.
No fire&mdash;two bare rooms cold and cheerless.
They all have scared faces. One can see they
expect good from no one. After a little, we gain
the confidence of the poor mother. We bring
out dresses, stockings, warm undergarments,
things to eat, chickens, and besides that, we leave
some substantial help to warm the room. Then
the mother begins to cry softly and the little girls
are so wild with delight that, smiling through her
tears, the mother tries to quiet them saying,
'children, have you gone mad?' As I turned
away from home after home they sent back the
message, 'May God bless Mrs. Booth and may
she never be hungry,' and wished for me the
same good blessing. Never be hungry! that is
the key-note, the best thing that these poor souls
can wish to the more fortunate, is that you may
never be hungry. What a story there is in that
sentence."</p>

<p>When this message from the chilly cheerless
homes was brought to me by our officer, strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
man as he was, the tears were in his eyes, and to
my heart the words opened up a whole vista of
struggle and suffering. "May you never be
hungry!" We should never think of giving
such a wish to our friends. Why? Because we
have never known the horror of the struggle
with that gaunt wolf at the door. With these
poor mothers he is an ever present nightmare.
It takes all their strength, all their time and
thought, to hold him at bay. Should they lose
their work or be laid aside through sickness, he
will force an entrance and some of them have
seen that dark day more than once, when his
cruel fangs have been at the throats of their best
beloved and he has crushed the little ones to the
ground beneath him. To them, that wish embraces
a condition of rest and satisfaction, of
comfort and safety, almost beyond their imaginings.
So to those who are kind to them they
wish the best they can think of. May they
never be hungry! Never know the dread and
anguish, the weakness and struggle, of starvation.</p>

<h2><a name="XII_PRISON_REFORM" id="XII_PRISON_REFORM">XII<br />
<br />
PRISON REFORM</a></h2>


<p>All punishment should tend to reform. The
thinking world of to-day recognizes this and the
tendency in our country is so thoroughly one of
advance, that to keep to the old systems of
prison government would be impossible. Even
during the past seven years, I have seen great
changes within our prisons and I want to speak
in the strongest terms of the earnest, faithful, humane
work, accomplished by many of our wardens
whose administration I have watched.
Prison reform is work that cannot be accomplished
by outside agencies. It is the specific
duty of those placed in charge of these institutions,
and they alone can fully see and understand
the needs of the great problem, for they
are closely and practically in touch with it.
Outside workers can of course help very materially
in educating public opinion, and in influencing
legislation, but so far as the work of improvement
in our prison system is concerned,
that must be accomplished by those who are
studying it, not as students of criminology, anthropology
or in theory only, but as students of
the prisoner and his requirements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>Every year in this country there is a gathering
of our prison wardens, when questions of the
deepest moment are discussed and opinions exchanged.
The papers read, ideas advanced, and
interest manifested, should prove to the onlooker
that these men are not contented to run in a prescribed
groove, but that advanced ideas and radical
changes are being most strongly advocated.
My personal experience has made me admire the
deep interest and earnest efforts of the wardens
whom I have come to know, but I have often
wondered if the public understands how much
their work is often hindered and thwarted by
politics. Many expenditures that the warden
sees are necessary for the improvement of his
prison, have to wait, despite his urgent plea, because
it is well nigh impossible to get sufficient
appropriations in some of our states for the
prisons. Money spent by the state on the criminal
population, is looked upon by many as an
extravagance. It would be found easier to get
half a million dollars for the beautifying of some
state building, than ten thousand for the improving
of the sanitary condition of a prison cell
house. Yet in the long run the latter expenditure
might prove a tremendous saving to the
state.</p>

<p>Then in every state throughout the country,
the appointment not only of our wardens but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
all officers in minor positions in the prisons
should be taken out of politics. I have seen
splendid, able men in charge thrown out because
of a political change in the state. They had put
their heart and soul into their work, and through
years of experience had made themselves familiar
with the needs and difficulties of their position.
They were in the midst of much needed changes,
when they had to step out, and turn over the
reins of government to some new man, who however
good, and able a citizen, was absolutely new
to the conditions in state prison, and would have
to begin at the beginning and learn it all over
again. I believe that this in the past has retarded
much good work at prison reform. Then
again in some of our prisons the wardens have
been terribly handicapped by the class of men
whom they have had under them as officers. In
many instances these men have been ignorant
and utterly unsuitable for the handling of the
prisoners. Good work that the warden might
accomplish has been thwarted by them, and yet
he has had his hands tied, having neither the
power to dismiss them, nor to choose and appoint
others.</p>

<p>In some states these unfortunate circumstances
have been corrected and in one or two, political
influence has no control in prison affairs. The
prison officer who is able and efficient and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
advances the best interests of the men should be
retained and valued, and only the one who
proves unfit should be removed. It is the interest,
the reform, the health, the usefulness of
the prisoners, that should have first consideration.
What right has a governor to sacrifice
them to please a party or a man who worked for
his election. A thousand, two thousand or perhaps
three thousand helpless human beings, for
whom the state is responsible, are at stake. We
cannot disregard this fact.</p>

<p>The appointment of chaplain has also been
political in some states. What a travesty on the
sacred office! There can be but one standard
by which to choose the spiritual adviser of these
souls in darkness. They need the most spiritual,
consecrated, self-sacrificing, hard-working pastor
who can be found, and any other would do more
harm than good. Above all, both chaplains and
wardens must be men who believe in the possibility
of the reformation of those under their
charge. The prisoner is very quick to discern
the pessimistic attitude of others. No one can
do satisfactory or effectual work who does not
truly believe that it will be successful, or at least
that there will be something to show for it.</p>

<p>Picking up an English book on the prisons of
the old world I read the following sentence,
"The governor of Portland Convict Prison said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
to me one day, I have only known two cases of
real reformation in thirty-five years." What a
ghastly confession of unfitness for duty! What
are our prisons for, if not for reform? Is this
vast expenditure by the country for its police
and detectives, its courts of justice, its prisons
and prison officials, to be thrown away so far as
the vast army of prisoners is concerned?</p>

<p>Most assuredly not in this age of civilization,
and I am confident no warden in this country
would ever give voice to so self-accusing a statement.
If he did, however, he would have his
fellow-wardens to reckon with, and after them
the great public would cry shame on him, and I
venture to say that the resignation of such a man
would be demanded at very short notice. There
is a pitiable side to this for the man himself.
What has he to show for thirty-five years of
service? A prison well guarded, men kept in
their hideous bondage without dangerous mutiny,
going like machines through the given
routine of hard labor, bodies clothed and fed
with only the average death rate, but no poor
soul bettered or made more fit to live in freedom
or face death happily. That statement can
be taken as the representation of the old idea
which was created with the old system, from
which sprang the abuses that were only to
brand, intimidate and degrade the man, who being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
beyond reform was to be kept in check by
breaking his spirit, and keeping him as far as
possible in a position in which he could do the
least possible harm to the community.</p>

<p>Not so long ago many of the branding and
degrading ideas were in existence even in this
country. I can remember the time when men
were hung up by their wrists for hours in torture
for some infringement of prison discipline. The
lock-step was at one time to be found in all our
prisons, the short hair cut and the hideous stripes
were universal. In prison after prison now the
lock-step is being abolished, and a manly military
march takes its place. Within the next
few years it will in all probability pass out
forever.</p>

<p>In many prisons the stripes have been replaced
by a neat gray or blue uniform, and they are
worn only by men who have been refractory or
attempted to escape. While we have the right
to punish the wrong-doer, and it is only justice to
himself as well as to the community to do so, we
have no right to brand him. Anything that
tends to mark a man or that will send him out
into the world incapacitated to take his place
among the free again, is a cruel wrong and
should be abolished.</p>

<p>In speaking of their doubt and distrust of the
man who has come from prison, people have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
quoted to me the unfavorable impression that has
been made upon them by the manner, the bearing,
the very speech of recently discharged men
with whom they have come into contact. They
have repeatedly said to me that the shuffling
uncertain gait, the head hung down, the shifty
look in the eye, and the fact that he can hardly
give a straight clear statement of what he needs,
have all gone to rob him of confidence, and people
have turned away merely to say, "I could
not think of employing such a one." Alas, in
the past, that picture has been only too true of
many a long termed man in the first days after
his discharge from prison. But what has made
him so? The world says a guilty conscience, a
shiftless unstable character; he merely shows
what he is, a criminal born! No! I answer he
is a criminal, branded, and in his poor crushed
body and hopeless mind, he carries the cruel
marks for which God Almighty will demand
justice in the great reckoning day. A thoughtless
world quick to condemn and damn the one
who has fallen, a brutal system that drove and
lashed instead of helped and raised the one in
servitude, will be held responsible for the shattered
minds and ruined bodies that can be found
amid the driftwood in the great under world.</p>

<p>Do you know what the lock-step is and does?
The shuffling column of men is not allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
step or march with a soldierly swing, but is so
near together that the arms of one man rest on
the shoulder of the one in front of him, and they
walk with the feet interlocked, so that each step
must be a sliding shuffle. Let a man walk thus
during the years of his imprisonment, and there
is not a detective or police officer, who could not
pick him out in the city throng, however well he
might be dressed. People complain of the shifty
eye, the downward glance of the man who they
say betrays by it the fact that he cannot look the
world in the face. Are we not taught that habit
is second nature, and what is the habit in which
these men have been drilled for years in some of
our prisons? They are forbidden to look up
from their work in the workshops should any
one pass through the room. If any one meets
them in the prison corridor or in the yard they
are to keep their eyes down, or, worse still, to
turn their faces to the wall. Take an innocent
man and drill him on pain of punishment by this
rule, and on his discharge he would unconsciously
do the same thing whenever accosted, and hence
very probably give the impression of insincerity.
Then what of speech? Many men to whom I
talk in prison or on the days subsequent to their
discharge, stutter and stammer helplessly, becoming
sometimes painfully embarrassed, as they try
to explain themselves. What is that but the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
of long silence? I do not argue that it
would be wise or possible for these men to be
allowed to talk freely in work shop or in cell
house, but I know prisons in which talking is
permitted during recreation in the yard, and I
do believe that the outside world is unfair in
drawing conclusions from an affliction brought
about by the silence system.</p>

<p>All these things should be remembered when
we stand in judgment on the man returned from
years of confinement. In this country all our
prisons save one, are on the congregate system
and solitary confinement is only used as a punishment.
No one who has been closely and
sympathetically in touch with his fellow-men can
fail to realize the unfortunate influence of the
solitary system. Human beings must become
warped and be disqualified for after life when
they have been robbed of all companionship.
The man shut away with his own thoughts and
those often of the worst character, is doomed to a
deteriorating influence that spoils the brain, and
often disqualifies the whole nature for reinstatement
in a rational after life.</p>

<p>Only the other day I heard from one of my
"boys" of two ways in which men have sought
to save their reason when long in the dark cells
for punishment. They are I believe much practiced
and well-known in prison. One is to take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
pin into the punishment cell with you&mdash;then you
divert the weary hours in that pitch darkness, by
throwing it up in the air and when it falls you
hunt for it on hands and knees and thus give
yourself an occupation. But, alas, the officer may
know of this, hunt for the pin and take it from
you, so perhaps the other practice is more sure to
keep the brain from madness. That is the spelling
of words backwards. I have at the present
time in our Hope Hall a man who can spell anything
just as quickly in that fashion as in the
ordinary way, and when asked why he taught
himself what seemed such a useless accomplishment
he answered, "I saved myself from insanity
by it." Ah! we who have freedom and light
and happy companionship, know nothing of the
battle and struggle, the gloom and the shadow,
that these men have had to face and live
through, and those who would help them and
would deal wisely with this problem must learn
to so understand it that they will be charitable
and patient in their judgment.</p>

<p>The greatest blessing to the man in prison is
work. I had the opportunity of witnessing the
cruel evils of enforced idleness, at the time all
work was taken from the men in the prisons of
New York through the labor agitation. A bill
was passed for the purpose of protecting the
outside market from prison-made goods. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
passed and suddenly put into effect, without
giving the prison officials proper time to prepare
for the consequences. Three thousand five hundred
men in state prison were thus forced to sit
idle in their narrow little cells day after day.
Some lost their reason! There were several
attempts at suicide, one man flinging himself
from the sixth gallery of the Sing Sing cell
house to a certain death. The wardens, sympathizing
deeply with the men, did all in their
power to help them, and felt keenly the difficult
position in which they were placed, and the inhuman
cruelty thus inflicted upon the men.
Naturally the plea of the world on the outside,
is that the working man must be protected but
the state is equally responsible for these men in
captivity, and it cannot afford to say as some of
the agitators for free-labor, brutally said at that
time "Well, let them go insane." Warden Sage
of Sing Sing told me to come as often as possible
to the prison, as he appreciated the opportunity
of letting the men out for some hours in the
chapel for my meetings. At Dannemora they
were allowed to go into the empty workshops in
charge of the guards that they might have a
change from their cells, and in each prison they
were allowed exercise in the yard once a day.
It was a grave time of anxiety for the officers
and of distress to the men. The matter was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
last adjusted by the provision in the law allowing
the prisoners to manufacture all goods needed by
state institutions, and in the large state of New
York that is quite sufficient to give the men all
the work they can do. By degrees, many new
industries were introduced into the prisons, and
the problem so far as New York is concerned
was satisfactorily solved. No sooner was this
plan made a success, than criticisms were heard
from labor circles again, and they would undoubtedly
have taken this work also from their
more unfortunate brothers, if it were possible for
them to change the law. Their sentiments seem
to be "let the convict go insane, what does it
matter to us. The State must look after him."
This is a very short-sighted view. It should not
be forgotten that many of these men belonged
to the world of honest, free labor yesterday, and
will belong to it again to-morrow. If they are
spoiled in physical strength and brain capacity,
the world will sustain a loss, to say nothing of
their claim as human beings to common justice
and humane treatment. Ask any warden to
name the one thing which above all others
would be productive of evil habits, insubordination
and mutiny in prison and he will answer
"idleness." The public should allow no legislation
that interferes with the proper occupation
of all able-bodied men in prison. There are objections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
that can be brought against the contract
system, but no change should be made where it
is in vogue in a prison, until such arrangements
have been made as will enable the officers to
introduce the change without leaving an interval
of idleness.</p>

<p>The system of using the money produced by
the work of the men for their own support is of
course perfectly wise. Out of the money realized,
the state can always make enough to clothe
and feed the men and in many prisons after that,
there is a large surplus. Great benefit could be
derived by using part of the man's earnings for the
support of his destitute family. It would be a
comfort to the man himself if it were made
possible for him to earn money for them, and it
would prevent the innocent from suffering with
the guilty. We are sufficiently in touch with
this side of the problem to realize how much
suffering this would alleviate and how many
lives it would save. It does not seem right that
a man should be cut off from his obligations
towards wife and children and aged parents, because
of his wrong-doing. Punishment should
curtail his own pleasure, should place him where
he could learn his lesson, and should save the
community from his depredations, but it should
not cast an honest woman on the streets, leave
little children naked and hungry, and wreck the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
homes which have sheltered them. It may be
argued that this is one of the unfortunate circumstances
that are beyond the power of the
state and cannot be avoided. I have talked with
gentlemen in authority over our penal institutions,
who have felt that it was not only possible
but should be undertaken as a duty of the state,
to make the man support his family by his work
in prison.</p>

<p>Good libraries and the night schools instituted
in many of our prisons are most important aids
in reformatory influence. In some of our prisons,
very fine libraries are already in existence,
and in those where books are lacking and the
state has not yet been able to provide them, donors
of libraries could find no more suitable fields
for their gifts. There are three hours every
evening, and all day on Sundays and holidays,
when the men have time to read. To many, this
will represent the only good opportunity for
study in a lifetime. The hard working man in
the tussle of life outside, comes home at night too
weary to wend his way to the library, and even
were he not tired, there are home duties to occupy
his attention. But the man in prison can
turn to books to pass the weary hours, and in so
doing widens his point of view and educates
himself. There is in every prison a percentage
who are uneducated, and also a foreign element<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
unfamiliar with our language. Many a man who
writes to me regularly has told me that all he
knows of writing and reading has been learned
in prison. We know that ignorance and the
lack of proper perceptions of the duties and responsibilities
of life, are among the things conducive
to crime, hence the educating of the
ignorant during the years when such education
could be encouraged or even enforced, could not
fail of good results. To increase the facilities for
teaching the men and to establish day-schools
also, to make it a part of the prison labor for all
the uneducated to learn at least the rudiments of
education, would prove excellent economy for
the state in the long run, and an inestimable
benefit to the prisoners themselves.</p>

<p>I believe I speak not from my own experience
only, which has been limited to seven years, but
from that of many of our oldest wardens, when
I raise my voice against long sentences and in
favor of a parole system. The long weary years
in prison unnerve&mdash;unman, and often break a man
down physically and mentally and there is no
compensating good to be gained. The shame
of detection&mdash;the disgrace of his trial and sentence
with the humiliation of the first weeks of
imprisonment constitute the man's greatest punishment.
After that the months and years are
ground out one after the other, without producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
any great change except on the harmful and
degenerating side of the question. Wardens
have often said to me in speaking of certain
men, "All that prison can do for that man is
done. He is as safe to-day to go at large as he
ever will be," and yet in the cases spoken of
there were long years yet to be served. The
state is not the gainer. The men lose much as
these precious years of life pass by. The families
are suffering on the outside, and the world at
large is robbed of their energies, which, if they
have learned their lesson, should be well used in
the future. By a good parole system, men when
reformed, could have a chance to prove themselves
worthy of full reinstatement in the world.
Liberty would be theirs before they had lost
courage, strength and confidence, and yet the
state would have them under surveillance, and, if
they proved unworthy, they could be returned to
prison. Undoubtedly the knowledge that they
were on probation would be a safeguard to many
men and would make them careful as to their
actions. I very strongly believe however that a
parole system to be truly just, should be extended
to all men proving worthy, irrespective of the
length of sentence for which their crime would
call under the old system. I would not say that
the man who had stolen a pocketbook could be
paroled, and the man who had committed burglary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
or forgery could not be eligible. Every
case must stand on its own merits, and the test
should be whether the man has shown signs of
genuine reform. Many of the long term men
are far more worthy of parole and are far more
worthy of trust, than some whose deeds have
called for a lighter sentence. Again the thought
comes up in this connection that it is the man we
are dealing with, and not the crime.</p>

<p>My work has sometimes been called "prison
reform work." That is erroneous. "Prisoner
reforming" would be more correct. I believe
the wardens of this country are the right workers
to advance the needed reforms and the best
able to do so, and it is the duty of the public to
stand by and help them, backing up the legislative
measures that they advocate as helpful to the
men in prisons. This especially is urged where
they have proved themselves earnest and faithful
workers on the advance lines of thought in
penology. I must not fail to speak of the excellent
work accomplished by Superintendent
Cornelius V. Collins in New York State, nor of
the earnest men composing the Board of Control
in Iowa. More such men with the liberty and
power to undertake the interests of the "boys"
will soon bring about a wiser and more practicable
system in our prisons.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII_DOES_IT_PAY" id="XIII_DOES_IT_PAY">XIII<br />
<br />
DOES IT PAY?</a></h2>


<p>In every enterprise that represents expenditure
of money, time or energy, the question naturally
asked by the practical business man is, "Does it
pay?" The capitalist expects the output of the
mine to bring in some substantial return for the
money sunk therein, and the quality and quantity
of the precious metal workable is of the greatest
moment to him.</p>

<p>It is natural that those who have helped with
their means should ask the same question of
work undertaken for the seeking of God's gold
in the deep, dark mine of state prison. If those
who have given money to such an enterprise are
anxious as to the result how much more must
those who have put time, life and strength into
the cause desire to see a paying return. Such a
work as this cannot be undertaken by any who
would enter into it as a fad or give to it leisure
hours. It must be a serious life-work and its demands
are great on time and thought, strength
and energy. Tears, and many trials through
dark hours of struggle and disappointment must
be endured, while weary days of unceasing toil
must be put into the work by those who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
succeed. Naturally, year after year, those who
have thus toiled have their day of account balancing
when they place what it costs into one
side of the balance, and into the other what they
have to show for it in tangible, practical, lasting
result. Since one has but one life to live, to
those who look upon life as a precious talent to
be accounted for, the question must naturally be
one of the most vital importance.</p>

<p>Very frankly was I told by prison officers, outside
advisers, and even by "the boys" themselves,
that the result of our prison work would be very
small compared to its cost. If, however, we value
the victory by the hardness of the fight that won it,
gems by the cost of their purchase, the edleweiss
with its snowy blossoms by the long and
dangerous climb up mountain crags to gather it,
in this field its very difficulties should make the
results of greater worth and moment.</p>

<p>It would be obvious folly to claim that such a
mission as this is uniformly successful. To refuse
to own that there are in it disappointments
and failures would be cowardice. In every work
that aims at the raising of fallen humanity there
must be a certain measure of apparent defeat.
The weakness of human nature and the tendency
of those who have once gone astray to retrograde,
if earnest watchfulness is for a moment relaxed,
make failure a very easy matter. Every minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
of Christ's Gospel knows of those for whom he
has prayed, toiled and struggled only to be
rewarded by their return to the evil thing that
has proved too strong for them. Amid the
twelve even the Christ Himself had this experience.
Avarice proved too strong for the
Judas who betrayed Him. Doubt made Thomas
forget the teachings and revelations of the Christ
as the divine Messiah, cowardice made Peter
deny his Lord, and there were many who forsook
Him when they should have been steadfast.</p>

<p>If retrograding is found in every field of
Christian work, this prison field can certainly be
no exception, especially when you take into consideration
the terribly heavy handicap these men
have from the enemies within and without who
must be withstood and overcome at every step.
The ever-open door of the saloon, the fellow-workmen
or old companions anxious for them to
drink the friendly glass, disappointments in losing
work, the sneer and slur of those who may have
learned of their past, combine to drag them back.
Above all, the old habits of evil doing and weakness,
that have become interwoven with every
thought and act and plan of life are as a fetter
upon their progress. These things form a solid
phalanx of foes.</p>

<p>I frankly confess we have had our disappointments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
and over them bitter tears have been shed
and painful heartaches endured. Some men have
proved unworthy, some have proved weak, but
they have been the exceptions to the rule. Many
thought we would have a majority that would
prove unworthy, and but a small minority to
remain faithful, but even had it been so, should
we have a right to say that the work was not
worth while? We have however to record that
the many have proved worthy and faithful, and
only the few have failed us. It is always a
lamented fact that it is just the few who do go
wrong, who arrive at public notice, while the
multitude who do well are never heard of through
the public press, but are hidden away in the quiet,
commonplace, workaday world of those who
tread the straight path of honesty. I can unhesitatingly
say that the results have already
shown such a return in homes made happy,
lives redeemed and wrong-doers changed into
good law-abiding citizens that we, who have
made the largest investment, feel a thousandfold
repaid. In my journeys hither and thither all
over the country, I am constantly seeing the far-reaching
results of the work, which, coming at
unexpected times and unlooked for places, are all
the more welcome.</p>

<p>I had boarded a "sleeper" at one of our large
terminal depots, and was bestowing my baggage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
beneath the berth in an already-darkened car. A
man in the uniform of the road hurried by me,
swinging his lantern. After he had passed me, I
looked up, and the light must have fallen on my
face, for he stopped with an exclamation, and
looking quickly to right and left to see if his
words might be overheard, he turned to me, and
stretching out his hand, said, "Little Mother, I
can't miss the chance of speaking to you. You
don't know me, but you will be glad to hear that
I am doing well, and have been living right ever
since I left the place where I met you last. I
have been making a good record now for nearly
two years, and all is well."</p>

<p>I had changed cars in a western city on a
somewhat gloomy day, and while I was rechecking
my baggage, a freight train pulled into
the depot. One of the crew sprang down,
making his way to me with a smiling face and
an outstretched hand. "Why I thought it was
you, Little Mother," he said as he held my hand
in his, blackened and hardened with toil. "I am
so glad to see you again, for I have only good
news to tell. I went straight home to my people
when I left Joliet, and they can testify to the
change in me, and now I am leading a happy,
steady life, and have proved that it is possible to
do so, despite the past. I have worked nearly
two years on this road now, and best of all, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
keeping my promise to God and proving faithful
to what I learned as a League member."</p>

<p>Arriving at one of the big Chicago stations I
stood undecided on the crowded sidewalk as to
which direction I should take. A voice hailed me
and I looked up to see a cabman waving his whip
enthusiastically at me. Thinking that after the
manner of his tribe, he was seeking a fare, I paid
no attention. Leaving his cab, he hastened to me
to greet me with outstretched hand and smiling
face. "Yes," said the officer at my side, "he is
one of your boys paroled from Joliet, and lately
he has received his full discharge."</p>

<p>I had been speaking in a crowded audience in
one of the large churches in the far west. At
the close of my address quite a number of friends
came forward to speak to me. A gentleman
grasped my hand and as I looked into the handsome,
intelligent face, I had a faint recollection of
having met him before, or was it only a resemblance
to some one I had known? As he
greeted me, I caught the gleam of the little silver
pin worn by members of the Defenders' League,
an organization of the friends of the Volunteers.
I said most cordially how glad I always was to
meet our Defenders, but his hand did not loosen
its grasp, and he was searching my face for a
more personal recognition. "So you don't know
me," he said at last. "No," I said, "I must confess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
I do not. Where have I met you before?"
"It was in Charlestown, Little Mother," came
the answer with that thrill of loving gratitude
that has so often warmed my heart in the voices
of many of my "boys." Could it be? Yes,
truly it was a young man who had gone from
our League in that Eastern prison years before,
and here he was, a prosperous successful business
man. "I have brought my mother with me,"
he said and my hand was laid in that of a sweet-faced
gentlewoman, in whose eyes a wealth of
love and pride shone through the moisture of
tears. That was not all, for he then told me
he had been recently married and brought forward
a beautiful young girl whom he presented
to me with the pride of a true affection. She
made the last of the happy trio who lived in
the pretty little home in the outskirts of that
city, where flowers and birds and almost perpetual
sunshine make the shadows of prison bars
seem very far away. Those prison days to him
are now but the nightmare of the dead years
which, through God's grace, will come again no
more.</p>

<p>At that same gathering I had started to leave
the platform when I found my way barred by a
little family group who had waited for me at the
steps,&mdash;father, mother and three little tots. In a
few brief words he told me he was one of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
San Quentin "boys," home now over a year and
that all was well with him. Then he left the
little wife to tell the rest of it which she did most
fervently, describing the earnest hard-working life
her husband was leading, and their now happy
home, while the tears that could not be kept
back, told their own tale of how much it all
meant to her and the three little children they
had brought with them to see me.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is a motorman who smiles me a
greeting as I board his car, or a waiter in a
restaurant who drops a word or two that have
nothing to do with the bill of fare. Once a cook
in white cap and apron ran out to greet me regardless
of the crowd of passers-by. Wherever it
may be, there are always the glad smiles and the
few earnest words that send me on way saying,
"It is all well worth while."</p>

<p>Some gentlemen in an office were discussing
the possibility of the reformation of prisoners,
and questions were exchanged concerning the
stamp of men reached at Hope Hall and their
sincerity. After the conversation had been carried
on for some little time one of the gentlemen
said, "Well, I am one of Mrs. Booth's 'boys.'"</p>

<p>A contractor came to seek men from our
Home, whom he said he was willing to employ.
After he had talked about the character of work
and the style of man needed, it was found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
he had himself some time ago, graduated from
Hope Hall, and now that he was successful and
prosperous, he returned to give the helping hand
to others.</p>

<p>As I travel in my lecture trips all over the
country, sometimes speaking for four or five
weeks every night in a different city, I am
brought constantly into touch with new audiences,
and in almost every audience, I find some
one of my "boys" who, seeing my lecture announced,
has come there to greet me with the
news of his well-doing. It is all these pleasant
surprises by the way that are helping to prove
to us how far-reaching and successful the work
has already become.</p>

<p>I have written much of our "boys" but what
of our "girls"? That question has been asked
me many a time, and in the first years of our
work I had nothing to report, as our efforts were
confined to the men in state prison. They of
course present the greatest need. This is evident
for two reasons; first, they vastly outnumber the
women, and secondly, there are no places for
them to turn to on their discharge, while throughout
the country there are many rescue homes for
women, where girls from state prison can be received.
Our work is not in operation in the
reformatories, lesser penitentiaries or jails where
women are mostly confined. We have kept exclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
to state prison, because the field is so
large that time and strength and limited means
compel us to draw the line somewhere, and we
naturally have chosen the field where the need is
the greatest. In many of the prisons we visit
there are no women, and where they are incarcerated,
there are very few. In New York state
for instance, the number is about fifty women to
thirty-five hundred men; in New Jersey about
twenty women to eight hundred men; in California
fifteen women to eighteen hundred men,
and so on. Where there are women, we have
started our League among them and recently we
have had several come home, some being paroled
to us while others have turned to us for help
when they have received their discharge. Of
course, they could not be received at Hope Hall,
which is a men's institution, but we have either
sent them to the Volunteer Rescue Home or
found positions for them at once.</p>

<p>One woman came to us with a sweet little child
in her arms, a prison-born baby who had never
before seen the outside world. It was a sad
story of a hard-working woman yielding to
temptation, at a time when woman through
physical weakness should hardly be blamed for
her actions. The little child that came to share
her sorrow was born in jail before her trial, and
together they were sent to state prison, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
babe was two weeks old, on a five years' sentence.
They were forgotten and abandoned by the
father and husband. After two years she was
paroled to us, but in that first return to the world
with the babe in her arms she was overwhelmed
by bewilderment and despair. She had no home.
Her husband had deserted her. One little child
had died of grief when she was sent to prison,
and two others were in institutions. The first
week she almost wished herself back in prison,
for she felt her bereaved condition so acutely.
We found her a good position in a Christian
family, where she has proved a most faithful
hard worker. The little one boards with good
people near enough for the mother to see her
constantly. This woman is receiving excellent
wages, and saving her money carefully, and she
hopes some day to make a little home for herself.</p>

<p>Another "girl" was a sweet-faced Jewish
maiden. The prison authorities hesitated about
her parole because she had been very hard to
manage in prison, and had been constantly punished.
This was probably due to a highly-strung
temperament, fighting against the confining
high walls and prison regulations. She came
direct to us and then went to work in a Jewish
family. Every month she reported to us and
her bright face and the good news she brought
always told a story of faithful effort to do right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
After she had received her final discharge papers,
she was married and now has a happy and comfortable
little home, with a kind husband well able to
support her, as he is a good workman. She runs
into my little office constantly with all the news
of her life, and advises with me upon every question
of importance. Her only sorrow since she
came home has been the loss of her first baby, a
grief which to her with her intensely affectionate
nature, proved an almost unbearable bereavement.</p>

<p>The next woman sent home had served eight
years. She was a respectable body who during
an unhappy wifehood had suffered much with a
drunken husband, and on whom prison life had
told severely. "Oh," she said when we first talked
together, "do get me a place with people who
will trust me. I will work hard and be faithful,
only I do want a chance to prove I am in
earnest." I sent her to work for friends of mine
whom I knew to be earnest Christians, where I
felt sure she would receive the kind words and
sympathy she needed more than the dollars that
would be paid her for her services. They have
sent me the best kind of news concerning her.
She has proved herself most trustworthy, willing
and helpful. In her turn she cannot speak too
warmly of her employers and their kindness, and
is perfectly contented and happy in her new life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>The next woman was a colored girl. She had
served her sentence and it was not her first
either, for she had seen the inside of one of our
big western prisons before coming east. Born
of respectable Christian parents in a southern
state, she had been led astray in the city of Chicago,
had gone very far down the wrong road
and lived for some ten years an evil life. They
did not think at the prison that she would come
to me, but she did. By a delay of trains she
reached the city at 4 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> and walked up and
down the streets until our office opened. "I tell
you, Mrs. Booth," she said, "I'd not have come
to you if I did not really want to be good. I
know where I could get money and where I
could find friends, but I am through with the old
life. I do not want to live like that any more.
Get me a place. I am not afraid of work and I
will prove to you I am in earnest." She is in her
place now, happy and hard working and those
who employ her, though they know the past,
never remind her of it nor have they been given
any cause to think of it themselves.</p>

<p>Our last girl to come home was a mere child
when first imprisoned. The crime was a terrible
one, it is true, but is a woman quite responsible
in the first hours of shame-shadowed motherhood?
When I heard of the long imprisonment,
I asked the question, "And what of the man?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Oh! the hand of the law that caught the weak,
unhappy woman, was powerless to touch him,
and she alone bore the weight of shame and
punishment. It was just a week before her discharge
that she held my hand tight in hers in
the prison office and pleaded, "Little Mother,
may I come to you? I am worrying so about a
place, and don't know what is best to do in the
future. I can work and I shall be so grateful for
the chance if you will trust me that you shall
have no cause to be sorry you did so!"</p>

<p>Such an innocent face was hers, such a willing
little worker the matron said she had proved herself
to be, and there were at home earnest, respectable
loved ones, longing to hear good news
of her, so there was indeed every cause to give
her the chance she asked. We talk of "by
chance" when we might better say "by God's
guidance." It was thus unexpectedly that two
days before our "girl's" discharge, I met a friend
who spoke of going away that week to a beautiful
mountain home. "Have you all the servants
you need?" I asked. "All but one," she answered.
"I have that one for you," I said, and
in a few brief words I told her the pitiful story
that was to be a secret, known only to the employer.
So our "girl" went straight to the very
best place she could have found, with a lady who
is herself an earnest Christian worker. Cheering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
words, busy occupation and beautiful surroundings
will chase away the memory of cruel wrong
and dreary imprisonment. Here is a letter from
the one who employed her.</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Booth:&mdash;I should have written
you before in regard to your girl, but have been
so busy since coming here that I have not found
time. I want to tell you I am delighted with
her and she will prove a most valuable girl. She
is capable, willing and so cheerful with it all.
She works in such an intelligent manner that it
is truly remarkable. She plods right along and
does not have to be followed up after she is
started at something. She certainly has had
good training in the 'big hotel' she talks about
having worked in."</p>

<p>Here is the girl's side of the story.</p>

<p>"My dear Friend:&mdash;I received your kind letter
last night and I hasten to reply. I like my place
very much. It is a delightful place! I wrote to
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; last week. She was so kind to me
while I was in her care that I feel it is a small
thing for me to write her once in a while. Mrs.
Booth, I do wish you could come to this beautiful
spot and rest here, for I know what your
labors are for us. I brought my Day Book with
me and read it and pray often for God's guidance
and blessing. Hoping you are well but not
tired, I remain obediently yours," etc.</p>

<p>So as we again turn back to prison to seek yet
others still within those gloomy walls, our hearts
whisper, "Yes, it does pay, it is all worth while."
And why should this work be any other than a
great and lasting success? Have we not the
right to talk confidently about it, and to glory in
it, when we know and acknowledge the source of
power, and the cause of the far-reaching influence?
The wire used to carry the current from
the dynamo has nothing to boast of, the pipes
that bring the water from the hills to the city,
need not feel diffident in the praise of the water
supply or its life-giving results! So we who are
privileged to be God's messengers, who can
sometimes prove the connecting link between the
human and divine, can glory in the blessed results
without a thought of self-intruding, for the
work is not human but Divine.</p>

<p>The one dark cloud on the otherwise bright
horizon is that which has across it written those
burning words "financial responsibility." They
flash out ominously every time we long to do
yet more along the line of practical help for our
"boys" and "girls," or for their dear loved ones
in poverty-stricken homes. Some day we trust
some man of wealth will take this special need
upon his heart and so endow this enterprise that
our hands and hearts may be free for the work
itself. Perhaps the help that will lift the burden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
may come from the many, as they learn how
much their little share in the responsibility would
count in the lightening of our care; or dying,
some one may leave behind him for those in
prison, a gift that will lay up a mighty treasure in
the fair country to which he has passed. I cannot
tell whence this help will come, but for it we
pray earnestly and without ceasing for the need
is desperate, and the burden is all too heavy for
those who carry it on. Tremendous, too, is the
responsibility for the lives and souls represented
by the work.</p>

<p>It may be well to state that "The Volunteers
of America" is a properly organized
American movement being incorporated under
the membership act of New York. We have
our duly elected and appointed treasurer and
our accounts are audited by a chartered accountant.
We publish a yearly balance sheet and, in
addition, any responsible person who cares to do
so, can go through our books and satisfy himself
as to the careful system of bookkeeping. Every
gift is receipted for, and monies are most carefully
expended. Mr. William J. Schieffelin of 5 E. 66th
Street, New York, will receive monies donated
to the special prison fund.</p>

<p>The prison work forms but one branch of the
movement under the leadership of my dear husband
Ballington Booth. It is working along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
home-mission lines in many cities throughout
the country, achieving among the artisan classes,
as well as the very poor, the most commendable
result. The local Volunteers in many cities can
of course help our prison branch by welcoming
and cheering the men who would naturally turn
to them as friends and comrades on the regaining
of their liberty.</p>

<p class="linespace2">Looking out over the great field, notwithstanding
the difficulties that still confront us,
there is one word that shines out supreme,
"Hope!" At first it was flashed to us from
above because of our faith in the Divine, now it
flashes up from below, as we catch the gleam of
the grain of gold in the many human souls still in
the shadow. So we can go forward with hearts
strong to endure, brave to suffer and warm to
sympathize, for we know beyond a doubt or
fear, that in the last great day of reckoning, we
shall find that the toil has paid in that coin which
is current in the world beyond.</p>
